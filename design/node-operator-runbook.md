# Hashi Node Operator Runbook

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> How Sui validators join the Hashi committee, covering prerequisites, configuration, genesis, key management, governance, and monitoring for running a Hashi node.

This runbook is for **Sui validators joining the Hashi committee**. It covers prerequisites, configuration, genesis, ongoing operations, and governance.

Hashi is a Sui-native **asset orchestration protocol** that secures and manages native BTC for use on Sui through threshold cryptography. [Committee](committee.mdx) members run the `hashi` service alongside their Sui validator to participate in MPC threshold Schnorr signing for Bitcoin custody. The committee collectively manages a Bitcoin master key, and no single validator ever holds the full key. The work your node performs is the [deposit](deposit.mdx) and [withdrawal](withdraw.mdx) flows, plus [reconfiguration](reconfiguration.mdx) at every epoch boundary.

This is a **living document**. Hashi launches on Testnet first. This document adds Mainnet parameters to the [Networks](#networks) table below as the team finalizes them. Wherever the runbook shows a network-specific value, use the column for your **target network** (the worked examples use Testnet).

This document assumes familiarity with Sui validator operations, Linux system administration, and basic Bitcoin infrastructure.

## Joining the committee

Onboarding takes 6 steps. The remaining sections cover the detail, the defaults, and the failure modes:

1. **Provision the two external dependencies:** a Bitcoin archival node (`txindex`, `blockfilterindex`, `peerblockfilters`) and a Sui fullnode serving the gRPC v2 API. See [1.2](#12-external-service-dependencies), [1.4](#14-sui-rpc), and [1.5](#15-bitcoin-node).
2. **Generate keys:** a dedicated TLS key, a fresh operator key funded with at least 2 SUI, and an OpenPGP backup key. See [2.2](#22-tls-key-dedicated), [2.4](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing), and [2.5](#25-backup-key-openpgp).
3. **Write the validator config:** use your target network's column in [Networks](#networks). See [3.1](#31-validator-config).
4. **Register your validator:** run `hashi register --print-only` and sign the result offline with your Sui validator account key. See [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key) and [5.3](#53-step-2-register-your-validator).
5. **Start the node:** run `hashi server` and keep it online, including across epoch boundaries. See [5.4](#54-step-3-start-the-server) and [9](#9-epoch-changes-reconfiguration).
6. **Monitor the node:** watch the key metrics and push them to the Mysten collection endpoint. See [8](#8-monitoring-and-metrics).

These details trip up most operators:

- Your Sui validator account key must sign the initial registration. The operator key cannot. See [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key).
- Hashi defaults `bitcoin-rpc` to port `8332`, the Mainnet port. On Signet you must set `38332` explicitly. See [1.5](#15-bitcoin-node).
- Fund the operator address with at least 2 SUI. Exactly 1 SUI fails with `InsufficientCoinBalance`. See [2.4](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing).

## Networks

Hashi is network-specific: the Sui chain, the Bitcoin chain, and their endpoints all differ per deployment. The runbook's examples use **Testnet** (Sui Testnet + Bitcoin Signet); for any other network, substitute the values from this table. Adding a network later is just a matter of filling in a column here.

The pairing is enforced, not just documented: Bitcoin mainnet goes with Sui mainnet and nothing else. `hashi launch` refuses to build the launch transaction when its `--bitcoin-chain-id` does not match the chain the fullnode reports under that rule, and a node refuses to start (as does `hashi register`) when the validator config's `bitcoin-chain-id` is mainnet on any other Sui network or is not mainnet on Sui mainnet.

| Parameter | Testnet (current) | Mainnet |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Sui network | Testnet | Mainnet |
| `sui-chain-id` | `69WiPg3DAQiwdxfncX6wYQ2siKwAe6L9BZthQea3JNMD` | `4btiuiMPvEENsttpZC7CZ53DruC3MAgfznDbASZ7DR6S` |
| Sui public fullnode | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` | `https://fullnode.mainnet.sui.io:443` |
| Bitcoin network | Signet | Mainnet |
| `bitcoin-chain-id` (genesis block hash) | `00000008819873e925422c1ff0f99f7cc9bbb232af63a077a480a3633bee1ef6` | `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f` |
| `[bitcoin].network` | `signet` | `mainnet` |
| Bitcoin RPC port (default) | 38332 | 8332 |
| Bitcoin P2P port (default) | 38333 | 8333 |
| `package-id` | `0xfcea10cadbb553c4874201584abf68771592678952efd957b2e82c010c7f4360` | _TBD_ |
| `hashi-object-id` | `0x22c0ce66ce09df2dc88a31bd320d4177b766518b9b88010368cfbdcd724528f8` | _TBD_ |

> A self-hosted Sui fullnode is reached at its RPC port (default `http://127.0.0.1:9000`) on any network. Hashi's built-in default for `bitcoin-rpc` is `http://localhost:8332` (the Mainnet port), so on Signet you must set the port explicitly.

## 1. Prerequisites

### 1.1 Resources

The requirements for running a Hashi node are **low** compared with those of a Sui node. To reduce blast radius, avoid **colocating** the Hashi process with a Sui validator. There should be no performance concerns with containerizing the process or running it in Kubernetes.

> **Testnet vs Mainnet colocation.** The separation guidance above (and in [1.2](#12-external-service-dependencies)) is written for **Mainnet**, where Hashi, the Sui validator, and the Bitcoin node should each run on independent infrastructure. For **Testnet**, colocating these on one host is generally acceptable, because the blast radius is a test deployment rather than custodied funds. This is an operational policy rather than something the software enforces, so **confirm the current expectation with the Hashi team** before you plan Mainnet capacity around it.

| Resource | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| **CPU** | 3 cores |
| **Memory** | 2 GB |
| **Storage** | 10 GB persistent |
| **Network** | 1 Gbps NIC / link |

> **Sizing notes** (preliminary, derived from June test runs and pending revalidation after recent fixes):
>
> - **CPU**: 3 cores for headroom, mainly the parallel-signing burst on the leader.
> - **Memory**: 2 GB is comfortable headroom; steady-state is well under this (a one-off ~3.7 GB spike came from a since-identified bug, not normal load).
> - **Network**: ~66 Mbps ingress / ~40 Mbps egress with the default MPC `(t, f)` parameters; a higher-throughput ("hybrid") configuration likely needs considerably more, so provision a **1 Gbps** link for headroom. Bandwidth tracks MPC protocol rounds (DKG, key rotation, presigning, signing), not individual deposit/withdrawal transactions; egress can be a meaningful cost, and the team is actively reducing this.
> - **Storage**: peaks around 1 GB; 10 GB is generous but fine.
>
> These figures reflect Testnet observations and might change for Mainnet.

### 1.2 External service dependencies

A Hashi node depends on two external services that you provide:

- **Bitcoin node** for your target network, reachable on **both** P2P and JSON-RPC (default ports per the [Networks](#networks) table; Signet uses 38333 / 38332), running as a **full archival node** with:
  - `txindex=1` (Hashi calls `getrawtransaction` on arbitrary deposit txids)
  - `blockfilterindex=1` + `peerblockfilters=1` (BIP-157/158 compact block filter serving for the embedded light client)
  - `server=1` plus RPC auth
  - transaction relay left on (no `blocksonly=1`, which disables `estimatesmartfee`); without a fee estimate the node won't build or sign withdrawals
- **Sui fullnode serving the gRPC v2 API** (`sui.rpc.v2` services, including the `SubscribeCheckpoints` stream). The public fullnode works out of the box, or self-host one if you want isolation; see [1.4](#14-sui-rpc).

> Run both dependencies on separate infrastructure from the Hashi node, not colocated on the same host, so a fault or compromise in one does not cascade to the others.

See [1.4](#14-sui-rpc) and [1.5](#15-bitcoin-node) for details.

### 1.3 Software dependencies

**Hashi binary.** Build the Linux x86-64 binary with the deterministic Docker build. It compiles in a pinned, reproducible environment, extracts the binary to `out/hashi`, and prints its sha256:

```bash
# Reproducible build (requires Docker); writes out/hashi and prints its sha256
bash docker/hashi/build.sh --no-cache
```

> **Which source ref to build.** Check out the ref for your target network **before** running the build. The script builds whatever is in your working tree. The repository does not currently carry release tags, and the binary reports a version derived from the git revision at build time rather than from a tag or a `VERSION` file, so the runbook cannot name the ref for you. **Confirm the current Testnet ref with the Hashi team** and build from that. Whatever ref you use, verify the result against the published sha256 below.

The build pins its base images, sets `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0`, links statically, and compiles `--frozen` with networking disabled, so it is bit-for-bit reproducible. CI confirms the same binary hash across runners. Each release publishes the sha256 of these deterministic binaries, so you can reproduce the build yourself and confirm your binary matches the published checksum. Compute the sha256 of your build and compare it against the published value:

```bash
sha256sum out/hashi
```

**Backup tooling.** Node backups are **OpenPGP** (Sequoia). To generate a backup key and decrypt backups you need an OpenPGP toolchain:

- `gpg` + `gpg-agent`, for decrypting backups, including with a YubiKey (works over a forwarded `gpg-agent` socket so you can restore on a server using a YubiKey plugged into your laptop)
- Optionally [Sequoia `sq`](https://sequoia-pgp.org/) (local keys) or [`oct` / openpgp-card-tools](https://gitlab.com/openpgp-card/openpgp-card) (YubiKey key generation)

See the [Hashi Node Backups](node-backup.mdx) guide for the full key-generation procedure.

### 1.4 Sui RPC

Hashi connects to Sui over the **gRPC v2 API (gRPC over HTTP/2)**, **not** JSON-RPC. The fullnode must expose the `sui.rpc.v2` services, including the **streaming `SubscriptionService`** (`subscribe_checkpoints`) the node uses to follow the chain. A fullnode that serves only JSON-RPC does not work.

| Setup | `sui-rpc` value | Transport |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Public Sui Foundation fullnode | `https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443` | gRPC over TLS (443) |
| Self-hosted fullnode (separate host) | `http://<fullnode-host>:9000` | plaintext gRPC/h2c (default 9000) |

Point `sui-rpc` at any fullnode serving `sui.rpc.v2` plus the `SubscribeCheckpoints` stream. The public fullnode (`https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443`) serves everything Hashi requires and works out of the box; self-host a fullnode if you want isolation from shared infrastructure. The node verifies the endpoint's reported chain ID matches `sui-chain-id` at startup and refuses to start on mismatch.

Set `sui-chain-id` and `sui-rpc` to match your target network, as shown in the [Networks](#networks) table.

### 1.5 Bitcoin node

Hashi talks to Bitcoin over **two independent channels**, both of which must be reachable:

1. **P2P**: an embedded [Kyoto](https://github.com/rustaceanrob/kyoto) BIP-157 light client connects over P2P to fetch headers, **compact block filters (BIP-158)**, and full blocks. This requires the serving node to advertise filters (`peerblockfilters=1`) and build the index (`blockfilterindex=1`).
2. **JSON-RPC**: used for transaction lookup (`getrawtransaction`), fee estimation (`estimatesmartfee`), UTXO checks (`gettxout`), chain info (`getblockchaininfo`), and **broadcasting withdrawals (`sendrawtransaction`)**.

For the **JSON-RPC** channel you can run your own archival Signet node or use a verified RPC provider such as [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) (or another provider that serves Bitcoin Signet). Whichever you choose, the endpoint must be **archival** (Hashi calls `getrawtransaction` on arbitrary deposit txids) and must permit `sendrawtransaction`.

The **P2P / BIP-157** channel (the embedded light client's compact-filter sync) needs a peer that serves filters (`peerblockfilters=1`). Run your own Signet node for this, or use a provider that exposes Signet P2P with compact-filter serving. The simplest setup that satisfies both channels is a single self-hosted archival Signet node.

**RPC methods Hashi calls** (so you can scope RPC permissions): `getrawtransaction` (verbose), `sendrawtransaction`, `estimatesmartfee`, `gettxout`, `getblockchaininfo`, `getblockheader` (verbose). Hashi requires **Bitcoin Core v29 or newer**; the latest release works fine.

**Installing Bitcoin Core.** Download the release binaries for **v29 or newer** from [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/), verify them against the published checksums and signatures, then extract and install:

```bash
tar -xzf bitcoin-<version>-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
sudo install -m 0755 bitcoin-<version>/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
bitcoind --version
```

**Sizing the Signet node.** This is separate from, and larger than, the Hashi process sizing in [1.1](#11-resources). Because the node must be **archival** (no `prune=`) and additionally builds `txindex` and `blockfilterindex`, budget disk for the full Signet chain plus both indexes, and provision headroom for chain growth and for the initial block download, which is CPU- and I/O-bound. Signet is far smaller than Mainnet, so a modest server is sufficient, but treat the disk figure as something to measure for your own deployment rather than a fixed number. **Confirm current sizing guidance with the Hashi team**; this runbook does not publish a specific figure for the Bitcoin node because it depends on chain growth at the time you deploy.

**`bitcoin.conf`, run as an archival, non-pruned node** (Signet shown; for another network use its ports and network flag from the [Networks](#networks) table):

```ini
# Hashi Testnet — Bitcoin SIGNET serving node
# ARCHIVAL: do NOT set prune=

signet=1
server=1
txindex=1               # getrawtransaction on arbitrary deposit txids
blockfilterindex=1      # build BIP-158 compact block filter index
peerblockfilters=1      # serve BIP-157 filters to the embedded light client
listen=1                # accept P2P (Signet default port 38333)

# JSON-RPC auth — use rpcauth (hashed) in production, or rpcuser/rpcpassword
rpcuser=YOUR_RPC_USER
rpcpassword=YOUR_STRONG_RPC_PASSWORD
# rpcauth=YOUR_RPC_USER:SALT$HASH      # generate with Bitcoin Core's rpcauth.py

[signet]
bind=0.0.0.0:38333                     # P2P
rpcbind=127.0.0.1:38332                # JSON-RPC (Signet default port)
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1                   # restrict to where Hashi runs
```

The corresponding Hashi config pointers (full template in [3.1](#31-validator-config)):

```toml
bitcoin-chain-id = "00000008819873e925422c1ff0f99f7cc9bbb232af63a077a480a3633bee1ef6"  # signet genesis
bitcoin-rpc = "http://127.0.0.1:38332"            # Hashi's own default is 8332 — you MUST override it
bitcoin-trusted-peers = ["127.0.0.1:38333"]       # host:port (port is mandatory)
# bitcoin-start-height defaults to 300000 on Signet (below the Testnet deployment); override only to change the anchor

[bitcoin-rpc-auth]
UserPass = ["YOUR_RPC_USER", "YOUR_STRONG_RPC_PASSWORD"]
```

> Notes: ports `38332` (RPC) / `38333` (P2P) are Bitcoin Core **Signet** defaults. Hashi does not default to them (its default `bitcoin-rpc` is `http://localhost:8332`), so set them explicitly. The light client runs in *whitelist-only* mode and connects **only** to `bitcoin-trusted-peers`, so that list must be correct and reachable. `bitcoin-start-height` defaults per network — `300000` on Signet (below the Testnet deployment, so the light client anchors under the first bridge deposit) and a post-Taproot height on Mainnet; override it only if you need a different anchor.

**Verify your node:**

```bash
bitcoin-cli -signet getblockchaininfo | grep '"chain"'    # must be "signet"
bitcoin-cli -signet getindexinfo                          # block filter index present
bitcoin-cli -signet getnetworkinfo                        # NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS advertised
```

## 2. Key management and security

### 2.1 Keys overview

| Key | Algorithm | Provisioning | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Sui validator account key** | Any Sui scheme (Ed25519, multisig, secp256k1, zkLogin) | Existing (Sui validator) | Authorizes initial Hashi **registration**. See [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key). |
| **TLS private key** | Ed25519 | Generate fresh (dedicated) | Peer-to-peer authentication through a self-signed cert. The node registers the public key onchain. |
| **Operator private key** | Ed25519 | Generate fresh | Signs the node's day-to-day Sui transactions (cert submission, governance, metadata). See [2.4](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing). |
| **BLS12-381 key** | BLS12-381 | Auto-generated at startup | MPC protocol participation. Stored in local DB. |
| **Encryption key** | ECIES | Auto-generated at startup | Encrypts MPC share exchange between validators. Stored in local DB. |
| **Backup key** | OpenPGP (Sequoia) | Operator-generated (file or YubiKey) | Encrypts automatic epoch backups. Required. |

### 2.2 TLS key (dedicated)

Generate a fresh Ed25519 TLS key dedicated to your Hashi node, separate from your Sui validator's TLS key, for clean separation of concerns. This key authenticates your Hashi node to other committee members, and the node registers the corresponding public key onchain during registration. Set `tls-private-key` to a PKCS#8 PEM/DER file path or an inline PEM string:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out tls-private-key.pem
```

```toml
tls-private-key = "/path/to/tls-private-key.pem"
```

Make sure the file is readable by the user running `hashi` (for example, `chmod 600` owned by that user). `hashi register` needs it to include your TLS public key in the registration transaction.

> A planned enhancement is for the node to generate its TLS key on startup, removing this manual step.

### 2.3 Registration must be signed by the account key

Your **Sui validator account key must sign and broadcast the initial registration transaction.** Onchain, `validator::register` sets the member's `validator_address = ctx.sender()` and asserts the sender is in the Sui active validator set, so no operator key can substitute for this first transaction. Registration places no constraint on the account's key scheme (Ed25519, multisig, secp256k1, or zkLogin all work); it requires only that the sender is an active Sui validator.

Because that key is typically in cold storage or a hardware wallet, use the **offline signing flow**: `hashi register --print-only` builds the unsigned transaction and prints it as base64 **without needing any private key**. Sign it externally with the account key and broadcast. (`hashi register --dry-run` builds and simulates the same transaction without executing it, reporting the gas estimate.) Both forms resolve the network's highest enabled package version on-chain before building, so the transaction targets the live package even after an upgrade; a build against a retired package fails in simulation instead of being emitted.

```bash
# Emit the unsigned registration tx (no private key required)
hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml \
  --operator-address 0x<operator-address> \
  --print-only

# Sign the printed base64 with the validator account key, then broadcast.
# If the account key lives in your local sui keystore:
sui keytool sign --address 0x<validator-address> --data <TX_BYTES_BASE64>
sui client execute-signed-tx --tx-bytes <TX_BYTES_BASE64> --signatures <SIGNATURE_BASE64>
```

For hardware wallets or multisig accounts, produce the signature with your own signing tooling instead of `sui keytool sign`; the broadcast step is the same.

**Handling the long base64 transaction.** The printed transaction is long enough to be awkward to paste directly on a command line. `hashi register --print-only` writes the base64 to **stdout** and sends all other output to stderr, so you can redirect or capture it cleanly. Save it to a file, then expand it from a shell variable rather than pasting it:

```bash
# Capture the unsigned tx (stdout only; notes go to stderr)
hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml \
  --operator-address 0x<operator-address> \
  --print-only > unsigned-tx.b64

TX_BYTES=$(cat unsigned-tx.b64)
sui keytool sign --address 0x<validator-address> --data "$TX_BYTES"

SIG=<SIGNATURE_BASE64>
sui client execute-signed-tx --tx-bytes "$TX_BYTES" --signatures "$SIG"
```

> This is a shell-quoting pattern, not a Hashi feature: `hashi` has no flag that writes the transaction to a file, and whether `sui keytool sign` accepts the transaction from a file or stdin instead of `--data` is a property of the Sui CLI that this runbook does not verify. Use `--data "$TX_BYTES"` as shown. If your shell rejects the argument as too long, the limit is your operating system's argument-length limit (`getconf ARG_MAX`), not a Hashi or Sui constraint.

`--operator-address` is the Sui address of the **fresh operator key** you generate in [2.4](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing). It is **not** your validator address. Passing it here delegates day-to-day signing in the same transaction, so the validator account key can go straight back to cold storage.

> Do **not** rely on the plain `hashi register` (execute) path for the first registration unless your configured `operator-private-key` *is* the validator account key. The builder forces the sender to the validator address while the execute path signs with the operator key, producing a signer/sender mismatch.

### 2.4 Operator key (day-to-day signing)

Generate a fresh keypair for the operator and fund its address with SUI for gas. The running node (`hashi server`) signs **all** its day-to-day Sui transactions with this `operator-private-key`: MPC certificate submission, governance, and metadata updates.

> **Fund the operator address with at least 2 SUI.** At startup the node moves 1 SUI into the account's address balance (used to pay gas for parallel transactions), so exactly 1 SUI cannot cover that bootstrap plus its own gas and the node fails with `InsufficientCoinBalance`.

All three simple Sui key schemes (Ed25519, secp256k1, and secp256r1) are accepted, in any of the formats standard tooling produces. The value may be a file path or the key itself inline:

| Format | Produced by |
| --- | --- |
| Bech32 `suiprivkey...` string | `sui keytool generate` / `export` / `convert` |
| Base64 keystore entry | `sui.keystore` entries, `sui keytool convert` |
| PKCS#8 PEM | `openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519` |
| PKCS#8 DER (file path only) | `openssl genpkey ... -outform DER` |

```bash
# Option A: sui keytool (writes <address>.key to the current directory)
sui keytool generate ed25519

# Option B: openssl
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out hashi-operator-key.pem
```

```toml
operator-private-key = "/path/to/hashi-operator-key.pem"
# or inline, e.g.:
# operator-private-key = "suiprivkey1..."
```

**Finding the operator address.** You need the key's Sui address to fund it and to pass as `--operator-address`. With `sui keytool generate` the address is printed at generation (and is the name of the `.key` file it writes). For an existing openssl PEM, derive it from the public key (Ed25519 keys only; `0x00` is the Ed25519 scheme flag):

```bash
openssl pkey -in hashi-operator-key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | \
  python3 -c "import sys,hashlib; print('0x' + hashlib.blake2b(b'\x00' + sys.stdin.buffer.read(), digest_size=32).hexdigest())"
```

> A raw hex private key (the `hexWithoutFlag` output of `sui keytool convert`) is **not** accepted, because it does not carry the key-scheme flag. Convert it to one of the formats above with `sui keytool convert`.

**Delegating to the operator key.** Delegation is set with `--operator-address`, normally passed during initial registration as shown in [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key), so one transaction registers **and** delegates. If you registered without it (or are rotating the operator key), run the same command again; it is idempotent and sends only the missing updates, but the transaction must again be signed by the validator account key:

```bash
hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml \
  --operator-address 0x<operator-address> \
  --print-only
# sign with the validator account key (cold/hardware) and broadcast
```

Onchain, every member action is authorized by `member_authorized(validator, sender)`, where the sender must be the member's validator key **or** its registered operator address. So once delegated, the operator key performs cert submission, governance voting, and metadata updates on its own, and **the validator account key can return to cold storage**. You need it again only to rotate the operator key or change registration metadata.

Metadata maintenance is automatic once delegated: at startup the node compares its config against the onchain member record and sends only what changed. To update your endpoint URL, TLS key, or other metadata, edit the config file and restart the node; no manual `hashi register` re-run is needed.

**Operator-key rotation is validator-only.** Only the validator account key can change the operator address (onchain, `set_operator_address` requires the sender to be the validator). A compromised or lost operator key therefore cannot re-delegate or lock you out: pull the validator key from cold storage, run `hashi register --operator-address 0x<new-operator> --print-only`, sign offline, and this action revokes the previous operator key.

> **Break-glass / backup.** Because the validator key always retains full authority, it doubles as a recovery key. If the operator key is unavailable, the validator key can perform any member action directly, such as signing the node's transactions or voting.

### 2.5 Backup key (OpenPGP)

Hashi creates encrypted backups of critical state (MPC key shares, DB, config) every epoch. Encryption needs only the **public** OpenPGP certificate, so the private key never has to be on the server during normal operation.

- **Option 1 (recommended): YubiKey.** Generate the key on the device; the private key never leaves it.
- **Option 2: local OpenPGP key.** Generate with `sq` or `gpg`.

Set the public certificate and a persistent, node-specific backup directory outside the database directory, writable only by the node's user:

```toml
backup-pgp-cert = "/path/to/hashi-backup-cert.asc"   # armored OpenPGP public cert, or inline armored text
backup-dir = "/var/lib/hashi/backups"
```

Key generation and restore are covered in the [Hashi Node Backups](node-backup.mdx) guide. Store the private key / YubiKey securely and separately from the backup files.

## 3. Configuration

Hashi uses two configuration files:

1. **Validator config**, used by `hashi server` and `hashi register`. Contains keys, endpoints, and all node parameters.
2. **CLI config** (`hashi-cli.toml`), used by governance, query, and deposit/withdraw commands.

### 3.1 Validator config

All fields use kebab-case. Optional fields show their defaults in comments.

> **Field order matters.** In TOML, every key that appears after a `[section]` header belongs to that section. Keep all top-level keys **above** the `[hashi-ids]` and `[bitcoin-rpc-auth]` sections (as in the template below); a top-level key placed after a section header is rejected at startup with an unknown-field error.

```toml
# ── Identity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Ed25519 TLS private key (PEM file path, DER file path, or inline PEM)
tls-private-key = "/path/to/tls-private-key.pem"

# Bitcoin Core RPC endpoint (Hashi default is http://localhost:8332 — override for Signet)
bitcoin-rpc = "http://127.0.0.1:38332"

# Trusted Bitcoin P2P peers for the embedded BIP-157 light client (host:port; port mandatory)
bitcoin-trusted-peers = ["127.0.0.1:38333"]

# Light-client sync start height; defaults to 300000 on Signet, a post-Taproot height on Mainnet (override to change the anchor)

# Armored OpenPGP public certificate (file path or inline) for encrypted backups (required)
backup-pgp-cert = "/path/to/hashi-backup-cert.asc"

# Persistent, node-specific backup output directory (required; restrict write access)
backup-dir = "/var/lib/hashi/backups"

# ── Optional Integrations ─────────────────────────────────────────────

# TRM Labs API key for AML screening on mainnet (when unset, screening is skipped)
# trm-api-key = "<your TRM Labs API key>"

# Guardian gRPC endpoint (when unset, the guardian integration is bypassed)
# guardian-endpoint = "https://hashi-guardian.example.com"

# ── Advanced Tuning (defaults are fine for most operators) ────────────

# Max gRPC message size in bytes (default: 16777216 = 16 MiB)

[metrics-push]
push-url = "https://metrics-proxy.testnet.sui.io:8443/publish/metrics"
```

### 3.2 CLI config

For governance commands, queries, and user-facing operations. Generate a template:

```bash
hashi config template -o hashi-cli.toml
```

> **Where the package and object IDs come from.** The [Networks](#networks) table at the top of this runbook is the canonical source for `package_id` and `hashi_object_id`; copy them from the column for your target network. `hashi config on-chain` shows the **onchain protocol configuration** and requires these IDs to already be set, so it cannot be used to discover them. Mainnet values are listed as _TBD_ until the package is published.

```toml
# Sui gRPC endpoint
sui_rpc_url = "https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443"

# Hashi package ID (original package address)
package_id = "0x<package-id>"

# Hashi shared object ID
hashi_object_id = "0x<hashi-object-id>"

# Path to the keypair for signing CLI transactions, in any format
# listed in section 2.4
keypair_path = "/path/to/operator-key.pem"

[bitcoin]
rpc_url = "http://127.0.0.1:38332"
rpc_user = "YOUR_RPC_USER"
rpc_password = "YOUR_STRONG_RPC_PASSWORD"
network = "signet"
```

### 3.3 Environment variables

All environment variables override their corresponding config file values.

| Variable | Overrides | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `HASHI_CLI_CONFIG` | n/a | Path to CLI config file |
| `SUI_RPC_URL` | `sui_rpc_url` / `sui-rpc` | Sui gRPC endpoint |
| `HASHI_PACKAGE_ID` | `package_id` | Hashi package ID |
| `HASHI_OBJECT_ID` | `hashi_object_id` | Hashi shared object ID |
| `HASHI_KEYPAIR` | `keypair_path` | Path to signing keypair |
| `BTC_RPC_URL` | `bitcoin.rpc_url` | Bitcoin RPC URL |
| `BTC_RPC_USER` | `bitcoin.rpc_user` | Bitcoin RPC username |
| `BTC_RPC_PASSWORD` | `bitcoin.rpc_password` | Bitcoin RPC password |
| `BTC_NETWORK` | `bitcoin.network` | Bitcoin network (`regtest`, `signet`, `testnet4`, `mainnet`) |
| `BTC_PRIVATE_KEY` | `bitcoin.private_key_path` | Path to BTC private key (WIF) |
| `HASHI_GAS_BUDGET` | n/a | Gas budget for transactions (MIST) |

---

## 4. Network and firewall

### 4.1 Inbound

| Port | Protocol | Source | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| **443** (default) | TLS 1.3 + gRPC | Other committee validators | MPC protocol messages, DKG, signing, deposit/withdrawal coordination |

The port is configurable through `listen-address`. It must be publicly reachable at the URL specified in `endpoint-url`, which is registered onchain.

### 4.2 Outbound

| Destination | Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|-------------|------|----------|---------|
| Sui fullnode | 443 (public) / 9000 (self-hosted) | gRPC over HTTP/2 | Chain state, checkpoint subscription, tx submission |
| Bitcoin RPC | per network (38332 on Signet) | HTTP/JSON-RPC | Tx lookup, fee estimation, UTXO checks, **withdrawal broadcast** |
| Bitcoin P2P | per network (38333 on Signet) | TCP | Kyoto BIP-157 light client (headers, filters, blocks) |
| Peer validators | 443 | TLS 1.3 + gRPC | Outbound connections to other committee members |

> - **Sui:** the connection is HTTP/2 gRPC. HTTP/1.1-only proxies (or anything that strips HTTP/2) break the checkpoint subscription.
> - **Bitcoin RPC:** the node broadcasts withdrawals through `sendrawtransaction`, so the RPC user/whitelist must permit it, not only read calls.

### 4.3 Metrics (localhost only)

| Port | Protocol | Bind | Purpose |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| **9180** (default) | HTTP | 127.0.0.1 | Prometheus scrape endpoint at `/metrics` |

Not exposed externally by default. Scrape from localhost or through a reverse proxy with access controls.

### 4.4 TLS

- Hashi uses **TLS 1.3 exclusively** with Ed25519 self-signed certificates.
- The TLS public key is registered onchain, so peers verify certificates against the onchain registry, with no certificate authority requirement.
- The node auto-generates certificates from the `tls-private-key` at startup.

---

## 5. Genesis procedure

Genesis forms the initial Hashi committee and generates the shared Bitcoin master key through Distributed Key Generation (DKG).

### 5.1 Timeline

```
Package Published → Validators Register → Launch (Admin) → DKG (Automatic) → End Reconfig → Presignatures → Operational
```

From DKG trigger to operational typically takes 30 to 120 seconds, assuming validators are online and reachable.

### 5.2 Step 1: package publication (admin)

The admin publishes the Hashi Move package. This produces the `package-id` and `hashi-object-id` you need in both configs; the values for each network are recorded in the [Networks](#networks) table.

At this point the deploy is **not yet configured**: the package `UpgradeCap` stays in the publisher's wallet, and the chain id and guardian parameters are not onchain yet. They land later with the launch step (`hashi::finish_publish`), the **launch switch** that unlocks genesis.

### 5.3 Step 2: register your validator

Registration must be authorized by your **Sui validator account key** (see [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key)). Use the offline flow:

```bash
hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml \
  --operator-address 0x<operator-address> \
  --print-only
# sign the printed base64 tx with the account key and broadcast; see 2.3 for
# the sui keytool sign / sui client execute-signed-tx commands
```

The registration transaction writes your BLS12-381 public key, Ed25519 TLS public key, ECIES encryption public key, endpoint URL, and operator address to the chain. [Committee](committee.mdx#registration-information) explains how the protocol uses each of these fields, and [why the committee is not exactly the set of Sui validators](committee.mdx#why-the-committee-is-not-exactly-the-set-of-sui-validators).

### 5.4 Step 3: start the server

```bash
hashi server --config /path/to/validator.toml
```

The node starts the gRPC+TLS server, connects to Sui (gRPC) and Bitcoin (RPC + P2P), registers its next-epoch keys onchain, and begins monitoring for the genesis trigger.

Booting **before the launch step is expected and required** because the launch only happens once every validator has finished key registration, which nodes do on startup. In this pre-launch window the onchain config is not finalized yet, so the node logs two benign warnings: the `bitcoin_chain_id` cross-check is skipped (it re-verifies on any restart after launch), and the guardian client is deferred (it resolves automatically from onchain config once the launch lands).

**This is the last genesis step performed by operators.** Steps 4 through 6 are handled by the admin and the network; keep your node running and watch the logs.

### 5.5 Step 4: launch (admin)

Genesis is gated on an explicit launch step. Once every expected validator has registered and started its node, the publisher runs:

```bash
hashi launch \
  --bitcoin-chain-id <genesis block hash> \
  --guardian-url <guardian gRPC URL> \
  --guardian-btc-public-key <x-only hex> \
  --keypair /path/to/publisher.pem   # reads ./hashi_ids.json from publish
```

This sends `hashi::finish_publish`: it finalizes the deploy configuration (chain id, guardian) and hands the package `UpgradeCap` into onchain custody, the launch switch that `start_reconfig` requires before it forms the initial committee. Before sending, the command lists the registered validators and flags any that have not finished key registration (the genesis committee would exclude them). The **initial committee is exactly the set of fully-registered validators at this moment**, so the admin should confirm the roster before launching. Multisig publishers can use `--serialize-unsigned-transaction` (with `--sender`) to produce the transaction for offline signing. `--dry-run` builds and simulates the launch transaction without executing it (also keyless with `--sender`), reporting the gas estimate. Automation can poll `hashi launch --status` (no keypair or guardian parameters needed) for a single machine-readable readiness line instead of parsing the human output.

**No operator action needed**, but your validator must be registered and running before the admin launches; otherwise it is excluded from the genesis committee.

### 5.6 Step 5: DKG (automatic)

Once the launch transaction lands, the first node to detect it submits `start_reconfig`. All registered validators then run DKG concurrently. **No operator action needed**; monitor logs for `start_reconfig`, `DKG started`, `DKG completed`. DKG times out after 600 s per attempt and retries until it succeeds or a newer epoch supersedes it.

### 5.7 Step 6: end reconfig (automatic)

After DKG, validators exchange BLS signatures over the result. Once 2/3 of committee weight has signed, `end_reconfig` is submitted onchain and the committee generates presignatures. **No operator action needed**; monitor logs for `end_reconfig submitted` and presignature generation.

### 5.8 Post-genesis verification

```bash
hashi committee list
hashi committee epoch
hashi committee view 0x<your-validator-address>
hashi config on-chain

curl -s http://localhost:9180/metrics | grep -E 'hashi_epoch|hashi_reconfig_in_progress|hashi_presig_pool_remaining'
```

Expected after success: `hashi_epoch` > 0, `hashi_reconfig_in_progress` = 0, `hashi_presig_pool_remaining` > 0.

---

## 6. CLI reference

### 6.1 Global options

```
--config, -c          CLI config file path          (env: HASHI_CLI_CONFIG)
--sui-rpc-url         Sui gRPC endpoint             (env: SUI_RPC_URL)
--package-id          Hashi package ID              (env: HASHI_PACKAGE_ID)
--hashi-object-id     Hashi shared object ID        (env: HASHI_OBJECT_ID)
--keypair, -k         Signing keypair path          (env: HASHI_KEYPAIR)
--verbose, -v         Enable verbose output
--yes, -y             Skip confirmation prompts
--gas-budget          Gas budget in MIST            (env: HASHI_GAS_BUDGET)
--dry-run             Simulate without executing
```

**Where these flags go.** These options belong to the **first-level subcommand** (`committee`, `config`, `proposal`, `backup`, `deposit`, `withdraw`, `balance`), not to the `hashi` binary itself and not to the sub-subcommand. Put them **after** the first-level subcommand and **before** the sub-subcommand:

```bash
# Right — flag sits on the first-level subcommand
hashi committee -c hashi-cli.toml list
hashi config -c hashi-cli.toml on-chain

# Wrong — the sub-subcommand does not know this flag
hashi committee list --config hashi-cli.toml

# Wrong — the top-level `hashi` command takes no options of its own
hashi --config hashi-cli.toml committee list
```

If you get an `unexpected argument` error, check the flag's position before anything else. Setting the equivalent environment variable from [3.3](#33-environment-variables) (for example `HASHI_CLI_CONFIG`) avoids the ordering question entirely.

> `hashi server` and `hashi register` are the exceptions: each takes its **own** `--config` naming the **validator** config, not the CLI config, so `hashi register --config /path/to/validator.toml` is correct. See [6.2](#62-server) and [6.3](#63-register).

If a command instead fails with `package_id is required. Set it via --package-id or in the config file.`, the flag placement is fine but the CLI config was not found or is incomplete; see [11.2](#112-configuration-and-cli-errors).

### 6.2 Server

```bash
hashi server --config <path>
```

Run the Hashi validator daemon. Uses the validator config.

**Running as a standalone service (systemd).** Operators who run the binary directly rather than a container can manage it with systemd. Install the verified binary at `/usr/local/bin/hashi` (confirm its sha256 first, see [1.3](#13-software-dependencies)), place your config at `/etc/hashi/validator.toml`, and run the daemon under a dedicated unprivileged user:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/hashi.service
[Unit]
Description=Hashi validator node
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=hashi
Group=hashi
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/hashi server --config /etc/hashi/validator.toml
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
LimitNOFILE=65536
# The node binds to :443 by default (the listen-address field). This grants the
# non-root process the one privileged-port capability it needs. Drop this line if
# you set listen-address to a port at or above 1024 and front it with a proxy.
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd so it picks up the new or changed unit, enable and start it, then follow the logs:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now hashi
journalctl -u hashi -f
```

Notes:

- The `hashi` user needs read access to the config and key files (keep key files `chmod 600`) and write access to the `db` path, which must be on persistent storage.
- The node writes structured JSON logs to stderr, so journald captures everything and there is no separate log file to rotate.
- This is an alternative to containerizing the process (see [1.1](#11-resources)), not an addition. Run one or the other.

### 6.3 Register

```bash
hashi register --config <path> [--operator-address <addr>] [--print-only] [-v] [-y]
```

Register or update your validator onchain. Initial registration must be signed by the validator account key; use `--print-only` for offline signing. Idempotent.

### 6.4 Committee

```bash
hashi committee list [--epoch <N>]     # List committee members (default: current epoch)
hashi committee view <address>         # View details for a specific validator
hashi committee epoch                  # Show current epoch info
hashi committee abort-reconfig         # Tear down a reconfiguration that overran its Sui epoch (section 9.3)
hashi committee start-reconfig         # Start a reconfiguration by hand (section 9.3)
```

### 6.5 Config

```bash
hashi config template [-o <path>]      # Generate CLI config template (default: hashi-cli.toml)
hashi config show                      # Show effective CLI configuration
hashi config on-chain                  # View on-chain protocol configuration
```

### 6.6 Proposals (governance)

```bash
hashi proposal list [--type <type>] [--detailed]
hashi proposal view <proposal-id>
hashi proposal vote <proposal-id> [--execute]
hashi proposal remove-vote <proposal-id>
hashi proposal execute <proposal-id>
hashi proposal execute-upgrade <proposal-id> --package-path <path>   # upgrade proposals only
```

Create proposals:

```bash
hashi proposal create update-config <key> <value> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create update-mpc-config [--max-faulty-bps <N>] [--weight-reduction-allowed-delta <N>] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create update-epoch-config <key> <value> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create add-config <key> <value> [--epoch] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create upgrade [--package-path <path> | --digest <hex>] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create upgrade [--package-path <path> | --digest <hex> [--allow-unverified-exclusive]] --exclusive <true|false> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create enable-version <version> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create disable-version <version> [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create update-guardian [--url <url>] [--public-key <hex>] [-m key=value]
hashi proposal create emergency-pause [--unpause] [-m key=value]
```

Config values are type-prefixed: `u64:30000`, `bool:true`.

### 6.7 Backup

Backups are **OpenPGP (Sequoia)**: encrypted archives use the suffix `.tar.asc`; unencrypted archives use `.tar` (format auto-detected on restore).

```bash
# Create a backup (uses the required configured cert unless overridden inline/by path)
hashi backup save <node-config-path> [--backup-pgp-cert <armored-cert-or-path>] [--output-dir .]

# Restore an encrypted .tar.asc — exactly one decryptor is required:
hashi backup restore <tarball> --backup-pgp-secret-key <secret-key-file> [--output-dir .] [--copy-to-original-paths]
hashi backup restore <tarball> --use-gpg-agent [--gpg-homedir <dir>] [--output-dir .] [--copy-to-original-paths]

# Restore an unencrypted .tar — no key needed
hashi backup restore <tarball.tar> [--output-dir .]
```

`--use-gpg-agent` supports YubiKeys, including over a forwarded `gpg-agent` socket. `--copy-to-original-paths` writes files back to the absolute paths captured at backup time (same-host in-place recovery only).

### 6.8 Deposit, withdraw, and balance

```bash
# Deposits
hashi deposit generate-address --recipient <sui-address>
hashi deposit request --txid <btc-txid> [--outputs <json>] [--recipient <sui-addr>]
hashi deposit request-single --txid <btc-txid> --vout <n> --amount <sats> [--recipient <sui-addr>]
hashi deposit status <request-id>
hashi deposit list [--json]

# Withdrawals
hashi withdraw request --amount <sats> --btc-address <addr> [--count <N>]   # --count submits N identical requests (default 1)
hashi withdraw cancel <request-id>
hashi withdraw status <request-id>
hashi withdraw list [--json]

# Balance
hashi balance <sui-address> [--json]
```

These are primarily for testing or admin use, not routine operator tasks. For what the protocol does with each request, see the [Deposit](deposit.mdx) flow ([request](deposit.mdx#request), [approve](deposit.mdx#approve), [confirm](deposit.mdx#confirm), and [mint](deposit.mdx#mint)) and the [Withdraw](withdraw.mdx) flow ([request](withdraw.mdx#request), [approve](withdraw.mdx#approve), [build](withdraw.mdx#build-tx), [sign](withdraw.mdx#sign), and [broadcast](withdraw.mdx#broadcast)).

### 6.9 Publish (admin only)

```bash
hashi publish ...
```

Builds, publishes, and initializes the Hashi Move package (including its onchain protocol and custody configuration). The admin runs this, not individual operators.

---

## 7. Governance participation

### 7.1 How proposals work

- Any committee member can create a proposal. Quorum is stake-weighted: most proposals require **2/3 of committee weight**, while an emergency pause uses a lower threshold (5%) so the committee can halt the protocol quickly (resuming again requires 2/3). See the threshold column in [7.2](#72-proposal-types).
- Votes can be added/removed before execution. Once quorum is reached, any committee member can execute.
- The `--execute` flag on `vote` auto-executes if your vote reaches quorum (except for Upgrade proposals).
- Proposals carry optional `-m key=value` metadata for human context.

> Governance actions are authorized by [member](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing): the signer must be the committee member's validator key **or** its delegated operator key, and the system records the vote under the validator for stake-weight purposes. So your operator key can vote on the validator's behalf.

### 7.2 Proposal types

| Type | Threshold | Purpose | Parameters |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **UpdateConfig** | 2/3 | Change an existing instant config parameter (applies on execute) | `key` and type-prefixed `value` |
| **UpdateEpochConfig** | 2/3 | Change an existing epoch config parameter (lands in the next committee) | `key` and type-prefixed `value` |
| **AddConfig** | 2/3 | Add a new config key to either store (insert-only) | `key`, type-prefixed `value`, `--epoch` for the epoch store |
| **UpdateMpcConfig** | 2/3 | Change MPC faulty bound / delta (epoch config) | `--max-faulty-bps`, `--weight-reduction-allowed-delta` |
| **Upgrade** | 2/3 | Publish a new package version with an explicit version-retirement policy | `--package-path` or `--digest`; required boolean `--exclusive` value; `--digest` with `--exclusive true` additionally requires `--allow-unverified-exclusive` |
| **EnableVersion** | 2/3 | Re-enable a disabled package version | `version` number |
| **DisableVersion** | 2/3 | Disable a package version | `version` number (cannot disable active version) |
| **UpdateGuardian** | 2/3 | Change guardian endpoint and key | `--url`, `--public-key` |
| **EmergencyPause** | 5% to pause, 2/3 to unpause | Quickly pause or resume the protocol in an emergency | n/a |

> EmergencyPause uses a deliberately low threshold so a small fraction of committee weight can halt the protocol fast; resuming requires the normal 2/3. Create it with `hashi proposal create emergency-pause` (add `--unpause` to propose resuming).

**Configurable protocol parameters.** The deposit and withdrawal flows read these settings directly: the confirmation threshold and the time delay gate the [deposit confirm step](deposit.mdx#confirm), and the cancellation cooldown gates a user's ability to cancel a [withdrawal request](withdraw.mdx#request):

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `bitcoin_deposit_minimum` | u64 | 30,000 sats | Minimum deposit amount (floor: 546 sats) |
| `bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum` | u64 | 30,000 sats | Minimum withdrawal amount (floor: 547 sats) |
| `bitcoin_confirmation_threshold` | u64 | 6 blocks | Confirmations required before the deposit becomes final |
| `bitcoin_deposit_time_delay_ms` | u64 | **600,000 ms (10 min)** | Delay between deposit approval and confirmation (fraud window) |
| `withdrawal_cancellation_cooldown_ms` | u64 | 3,600,000 ms (1 hr) | Cooldown before a withdrawal can be cancelled |
| `paused` | bool | false | Pause all deposit/withdrawal processing |

> The CLI `update-config --help` lists a subset of keys (`bitcoin_deposit_minimum`, `bitcoin_withdrawal_minimum`, `bitcoin_confirmation_threshold`, `withdrawal_cancellation_cooldown_ms`, `paused`); `bitcoin_deposit_time_delay_ms` is still settable.

### 7.3 Lifecycle example: UpdateConfig

Executed proposals stay on chain for inspection. Voting on, removing a vote from, or executing one is refused before anything is signed, with a message that names the proposal and its type; `hashi proposal view <id>` shows `Status: Executed`, `Active (expires <date>)`, or `Expired` for a proposal past its seven-day window.

```bash
# 1. Create the proposal
hashi proposal create update-config bitcoin_deposit_minimum u64:50000 \
  -m reason="Increase minimum to reduce small-value UTXO accumulation"
# note the proposal ID: 0x<proposal-id>

# 2. Share the proposal ID with other committee members

# 3. Vote (--execute auto-executes if quorum is reached)
hashi proposal vote 0x<proposal-id> --execute

# 4. Check status
hashi proposal view 0x<proposal-id>

# 5. Execute manually if needed
hashi proposal execute 0x<proposal-id>

# 6. Verify
hashi config on-chain
```

### 7.4 Package upgrade flow

Every package upgrade must first be classified as exclusive or non-exclusive.
See [Move Package Upgrades](move-upgrades.mdx) for the safety criteria, binary
rollout contract, and the special testnet v1-to-v2 sequence.

```bash
# Build and propose (CLI verifies PACKAGE_VERSION is incremented)
hashi proposal create upgrade --exclusive true --package-path /path/to/packages/hashi

# Vote (--execute is NOT supported for Upgrade proposals)
hashi proposal vote 0x<proposal-id>

# After quorum: one programmable transaction executes the proposal, publishes
# the package, and finalizes the upgrade. Build from the same commit, with the
# same `sui`, that produced the proposal's digest. The generic
# `proposal execute` command rejects upgrade types.
hashi proposal execute-upgrade 0x<proposal-id> --package-path /path/to/packages/hashi
```

## 8. Monitoring and metrics

### 8.1 Prometheus endpoint

Metrics are served at `http://127.0.0.1:9180/metrics` (configurable through `metrics-http-address`).

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9180/metrics | grep hashi_
```

### 8.2 Metrics push

Configure the node to push its metrics to the Mysten-operated collection endpoint. The Hashi team relies on this for fleet-wide visibility during Testnet, so every operator must include this section in the validator config:

```toml
[metrics-push]
push-url = "https://metrics-proxy.testnet.sui.io:8443/publish/metrics"
# How often to push (default: 60)
# push-interval-seconds = 60
```

Notes:

- `[metrics-push]` is a TOML table: keep it at the **end** of the config file with the other sections, per the field-order note in [3.1](#31-validator-config).
- **No extra credentials are needed.** The push authenticates with your existing `tls-private-key` as a TLS client identity, verified against the TLS public key you registered onchain. It therefore only works after your registration is complete.
- The node does not fail without this section; it silently starts without the push task. Check your config if the team reports not seeing your metrics.

### 8.3 Key metrics

| Metric | Type | What to Watch |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `uptime` | gauge | Node uptime (s). Labels: `version`, `sui_chain_id`, `bitcoin_chain_id`, `package_id`. |
| `hashi_epoch` | gauge | Current Hashi epoch. Should advance with Sui epochs. |
| `hashi_sui_epoch` | gauge | Current Sui epoch. |
| `hashi_sui_rpc_info` | gauge | Configured Sui RPC endpoint. The `endpoint` label identifies the fullnode used by this validator. |
| `hashi_reconfig_in_progress` | gauge | 1 during reconfiguration. Extended periods = problem. |
| `hashi_reconfig_aborted_total` | counter | Reconfigurations torn down by `abort_reconfig`, whoever submitted it. Each one means a reconfiguration stalled for a whole Sui epoch. |
| `hashi_paused` | gauge | 1 when the onchain `paused` config flag is set (governance emergency pause). Healthy: `0`. This tracks the governance flag only. The separate pause that occurs during reconfiguration is reflected by `hashi_reconfig_in_progress`, not here. |
| `hashi_reconfig_hold` | gauge | 1 when the onchain `reconfig_hold` config flag is set: the chain refuses `start_reconfig`, so Hashi stays behind Sui's epoch on its current committee until governance clears it (section 9.3). Healthy: `0`. |
| `hashi_presig_pool_remaining` | gauge | Presignatures available. Should not reach 0. |
| `hashi_is_leader` | gauge | 1 when this node is the current leader. |
| `hashi_kyoto_synced` | gauge | 1 when the Bitcoin light client is synced. Healthy: `1` in steady state. |
| `hashi_kyoto_best_height` | gauge | Bitcoin tip block height. Healthy: tracks your Bitcoin node's `getblockchaininfo` height. |
| `hashi_kyoto_connected_peers` | gauge | Bitcoin P2P peer count. See the note below on what value is healthy. |
| `hashi_kyoto_sync_percent` | gauge | Compact block filter sync progress (0–100). Healthy: reaches `100`; should climb during initial sync. |
| `hashi_kyoto_restarts_total` | counter | Light client restarts after connectivity loss. Healthy: flat. |
| `hashi_kyoto_consecutive_failures` | gauge | Consecutive peer connection failures. Healthy: `0`. |
| `hashi_deposit_queue_size` | gauge | Pending deposit requests. |
| `hashi_withdrawal_queue_size` | gauge | Pending withdrawals (by status). |
| `hashi_utxo_pool_size` | gauge | Managed UTXOs (available / unconfirmed_change / locked). |
| `hashi_mpc_sign_failures_total` | counter | MPC signing failures. Investigate if increasing. |
| `hashi_mpc_reconfig_total_duration_seconds` | histogram | DKG/rotation duration. |
| `hashi_sui_tx_submissions_total` | counter | Sui tx submissions (by operation, status). |
| `hashi_sui_balance` | gauge | Operator gas wallet SUI balance in MIST (owned coins + address balance), labeled `address` with the operator address paying gas. `-1` until the first successful sample. |
| `hashi_leader_retries_total` | counter | Leader operation retries (by operation, error kind). |

> **Is `hashi_kyoto_connected_peers = 1` healthy? Yes.** The embedded light client runs in whitelist-only mode and connects **only** to the peers listed in `bitcoin-trusted-peers` (see [1.5](#15-bitcoin-node)), so it never discovers peers through DNS seeds or address gossip. The count therefore cannot exceed the number of trusted peers you configured, and `1` is the expected steady-state value for the common single-self-hosted-node setup. What matters is that the value is **non-zero and stable**: the alert in [8.4](#84-suggested-alerts) fires on `== 0`, not on a low count. If you want redundancy here, add more entries to `bitcoin-trusted-peers` rather than expecting the number to grow on its own.

**Checking committee membership and status.** Committee state is queried through the CLI (note the flag placement from [6.1](#61-global-options)):

```bash
hashi committee -c hashi-cli.toml list            # all members for the current epoch
hashi committee -c hashi-cli.toml view 0x<addr>   # one validator's details
hashi committee -c hashi-cli.toml epoch           # current epoch info
```

See [Committee](committee.mdx) for what membership means and how Hashi derives the member set from the Sui validator set.

> The **CLI is the status of record** for committee membership. This runbook does not link a public explorer view for Hashi committee state, because none is confirmed; do not rely on a third-party dashboard to determine whether your node is in the committee.

### 8.4 Suggested alerts

| Condition | Severity | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `hashi_reconfig_in_progress == 1` for > 10 min | Critical | Check logs for DKG/rotation errors. Nodes abort and restart it themselves once it overruns its Sui epoch; `hashi committee abort-reconfig` is the manual fallback (section 9.3). |
| `increase(hashi_reconfig_aborted_total[1h]) > 0` | Warning | A reconfiguration stalled for a full Sui epoch and was aborted; the replacement starts on its own. Find out why the first one stalled (offline stake, bad endpoints or keys, partitions). |
| `hashi_presig_pool_remaining == 0` | Critical | Node cannot sign. Check reconfig status and MPC logs. |
| `hashi_kyoto_synced == 0` for > 5 min | Warning | Light client lost sync. Check Bitcoin RPC and P2P connectivity. |
| `hashi_kyoto_connected_peers == 0` | Warning | No Bitcoin P2P peers. Check `bitcoin-trusted-peers` and reachability. |
| `hashi_mpc_sign_failures_total` increasing | Warning | Investigate MPC protocol errors in logs. |
| `hashi_sui_balance < 1e9 and hashi_sui_balance >= 0` (below 1 SUI) | Warning | Gas wallet running low; the node stops landing Sui transactions when it empties. Top up the `address` named in the alert's labels. (`-1` means not yet sampled, not empty.) |
| `up == 0` (Prometheus target down) | Critical | Node is down. Restart and check logs. |

> **Coming soon:** A metrics **push** service for centralized collection. Details follow once it lands.

## 9. Epoch changes (reconfiguration)

### 9.1 What happens automatically

On every Sui epoch change, the Hashi committee reconfigures:

1. A node detects the Sui epoch change and submits `start_reconfig`.
2. The system pauses deposit and withdrawal processing.
3. **Key rotation** runs. The old committee redistributes key shares to the new committee (the Bitcoin master public key is unchanged). The genesis epoch runs DKG instead.
4. Validators exchange BLS signatures; once 2/3 weight signs, `end_reconfig` is submitted.
5. The new committee generates presignatures.
6. Normal operations resume.

[Reconfiguration](reconfiguration.mdx) covers the onchain detail behind each step: [start reconfig](reconfiguration.mdx#start-reconfig), [DKG or key rotation](reconfiguration.mdx#dkg-or-key-rotation), [end reconfig](reconfiguration.mdx#end-reconfig), and [abort reconfig](reconfiguration.mdx#abort-reconfig).

### 9.2 Operator responsibilities

- **Keep your node online across epoch boundaries.** It must participate in key rotation.
- **Keep registration metadata current.** If you change endpoint URL, TLS key, or other registration info, re-run `hashi register` before the next epoch change. Metadata updates accept either the operator or the validator key.
- **Monitor reconfiguration.** Watch `hashi_reconfig_in_progress` and `hashi_mpc_reconfig_total_duration_seconds`.

### 9.3 Stuck reconfigurations

A reconfiguration must complete within the Sui epoch it started in. If it stalls (offline validators, misconfigured endpoints, protocol failures), the nodes handle it: at the next Sui epoch boundary they stop working on it, one of them submits `abort_reconfig` (no proposal or vote is involved; the chain settles the race), and they submit a fresh `start_reconfig` as soon as the abort is reflected. `hashi_reconfig_aborted_total` counts these; alert on it and find out why the reconfiguration stalled. Common causes: too much registered stake offline/unreachable, invalid endpoints or stale TLS keys, network partitions preventing MPC message exchange.

If no node is running to do this, anyone can abort by hand:

```bash
hashi committee abort-reconfig
```

The chain accepts the abort only while a reconfiguration is pending **and** its target epoch is no longer Sui's current epoch; the command checks both up front and refuses otherwise. While the pending epoch is still current, the reconfiguration is inside its window and must be left to complete. After the abort, the previous committee resumes and any running node that observes it starts the replacement reconfiguration right away.

The replacement can be started by hand as well, for when no node is running to submit it or `hashi_epoch` stays behind `hashi_sui_epoch` with `hashi_reconfig_in_progress` at `0`:

```bash
hashi committee start-reconfig
```

The chain accepts it only while nothing is pending and Hashi's epoch lags Sui's; the command checks both up front and refuses otherwise. Every running node then drives the new reconfiguration as usual.

To stay on the previous committee instead, for example while the cause of the stall is fixed so the replacement does not stall the same way, have governance set the `reconfig_hold` config flag before the abort lands:

```bash
hashi proposal create update-config reconfig_hold bool:true
```

Once the proposal executes, `start_reconfig` aborts on chain, nodes stop submitting it (`hashi_reconfig_hold` reads `1`), and the previous committee keeps serving deposits and withdrawals. The overrun reconfiguration is still aborted as usual, and a reconfiguration already pending still completes.

Clear the flag with another `update-config` proposal (`bool:false`). Clearing it does not itself start anything: nodes submit `start_reconfig` when they see a Sui epoch change, an abort, or on startup, and nothing watches the config for this. So after clearing, the replacement waits for the next Sui epoch change unless an operator starts it by hand:

```bash
hashi committee start-reconfig
```

---

## 10. Backup and restore

The full key-generation and restore procedures (including YubiKey setup with `oct` and decrypting over SSH) are in the [Hashi Node Backups](node-backup.mdx) guide. This section is a quick summary.

The node automatically writes an encrypted backup every epoch using the required `backup-pgp-cert`: it packs the DB (MPC key shares, signing/encryption keys), config, and referenced key files into a tar archive and wraps it as an ASCII-armored OpenPGP (Sequoia) message. Encrypted archives use the suffix `.tar.asc`; unencrypted archives use `.tar`. Backups go to the required `backup-dir` and follow the retention policy in the [backup guide](node-backup.mdx#configuring-hashi). Encryption needs only the public certificate, so the private key need not be present during normal operation.

Because backups use OpenPGP, you can restore over SSH: plug the YubiKey into your laptop, forward your `gpg-agent` to the server, and decrypt the backup there. The private key never leaves the YubiKey.

```bash
# Manual backup
hashi backup save /path/to/validator.toml \
  --backup-pgp-cert /path/to/hashi-backup-cert.asc \
  --output-dir /var/lib/hashi/backups

# Restore with a local OpenPGP secret key
hashi backup restore /var/lib/hashi/backups/hashi-backup-*.tar.asc \
  --backup-pgp-secret-key /path/to/secret-key.asc \
  --output-dir /var/lib/hashi/restore

# Restore via gpg-agent / YubiKey (works over a forwarded agent)
hashi backup restore /var/lib/hashi/backups/hashi-backup-*.tar.asc \
  --use-gpg-agent [--gpg-homedir /path/to/gnupghome] \
  --output-dir /var/lib/hashi/restore
```

## 11. Troubleshooting

Common failures, grouped by where they surface. Each entry gives the **symptom**, the **likely cause**, and the **fix**. Where an error message originates in Sui tooling rather than in Hashi itself, this section says so, because the exact wording can change independently of Hashi.

### 11.1 Node fails to start

**Symptom:** the process panics at startup with:

```
thread 'main' panicked at ...: called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value
```

**Likely cause:** a required value is missing from the **validator config**. Every field in the validator config is optional as far as parsing is concerned, so a missing field is not caught when the file is read. It surfaces later as a panic during startup. Two config values produce this panic:

- **`sui-rpc` is not set.** This is the most common case, because the chain-ID verification that reads it is one of the first things the node does after startup.
- **`bitcoin-chain-id` is set to a value that is not a recognized genesis block hash** (a typo, or a hash from a different Bitcoin network). The node maps this hash to a Bitcoin network and has no fallback when the hash is unrecognized.

**Fix:** set both explicitly, using the values for your target network from the [Networks](#networks) table:

```toml
sui-rpc = "https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443"
bitcoin-chain-id = "00000008819873e925422c1ff0f99f7cc9bbb232af63a077a480a3633bee1ef6"  # signet genesis
```

---

**Symptom:** startup fails with `refusing Bitcoin mainnet (...) on Sui chain ...: Bitcoin mainnet is allowed on Sui mainnet only ...` or `refusing Bitcoin Signet (...) on Sui mainnet: Sui mainnet requires Bitcoin mainnet`.

**Likely cause:** the validator config pairs a Sui network with the wrong Bitcoin network. On Sui Testnet the usual case is a missing `bitcoin-chain-id`, which defaults to Bitcoin mainnet. `hashi register` reports the same error for the same config.

**Fix:** set `bitcoin-chain-id` to the genesis hash from the [Networks](#networks) table for your Sui network.

---

**Symptom:** startup fails with ``missing required `db` in node config``.

**Likely cause:** the `db` field is absent. Unlike the two values above, this one is reported as a clean error rather than a panic.

**Fix:** set `db` to a persistent path, for example `db = "/var/lib/hashi/db"`.

---

**Symptom:** the config file is rejected on load because of an unknown field.

**Likely cause:** a misspelled or wrongly-cased key. The validator config rejects unknown fields outright, and its keys are **kebab-case** (`sui-rpc`, `bitcoin-chain-id`, `tls-private-key`), not snake_case. The **CLI** config in [3.2](#32-cli-config) uses snake_case (`sui_rpc_url`, `package_id`), so the two files do not share a convention.

**Fix:** correct the key to kebab-case and re-check it against the template in [3.1](#31-validator-config).

---

**Symptom:** the node starts, but every onchain lookup behaves as though Hashi does not exist.

**Likely cause:** the `[hashi-ids]` section is missing. When it is absent the node falls back to the zero address (`0x0`) for both `package_id` and `hashi_object_id` rather than refusing to start, so the failure appears later as lookups against a package that is not there.

**Fix:** set both IDs from the [Networks](#networks) table.

### 11.2 Configuration and CLI errors

**Symptom:**

```
package_id is required. Set it via --package-id or in the config file.
```

(or the same message for `hashi_object_id`)

**Likely cause:** the CLI could not find a CLI config, or found one that does not set the IDs. Two traps account for most occurrences:

1. **The template is not written where the CLI looks for it.** `hashi config template` writes `hashi-cli.toml` into the **current directory** by default, but when you do not pass `--config`, the CLI's default search path is `.hashi/localnet/hashi-cli.toml`, relative to the current directory. Generating a template and then running a command without `-c` therefore does **not** pick it up. There is no fallback to a location in your home directory.
2. **The template ships with both IDs commented out.** Generating it is not enough; you must uncomment and fill them in.

**Fix:** generate the template, fill in the IDs, and pass it explicitly, remembering the flag placement from [6.1](#61-global-options):

```bash
hashi config template -o hashi-cli.toml
# edit hashi-cli.toml: uncomment and set package_id and hashi_object_id
hashi config -c hashi-cli.toml show      # confirm the values are picked up
```

Or bypass the file entirely with environment variables, which always override file values:

```bash

```

> `hashi config on-chain` cannot be used to discover these IDs: it needs them already configured in order to connect, so it reports this same error when they are missing.

---

**Symptom:**

```
Some requested entity was not found
```

**Likely cause:** this is the gRPC `NotFound` status coming back from the Sui fullnode, not a Hashi-authored message. It means the object or package you asked for does not exist **on the chain you are talking to**. In practice: `package_id` or `hashi_object_id` is wrong or still unset (see the zero-address fallback in [11.1](#111-node-fails-to-start)), or the IDs are right but `sui_rpc_url` points at a different network. Testnet IDs queried against a Mainnet fullnode fail exactly this way.

**Fix:** confirm the IDs and the endpoint agree with a single column of the [Networks](#networks) table:

```bash
hashi config -c hashi-cli.toml show      # shows the effective IDs and endpoint
```

The validator config additionally verifies that the fullnode's reported chain ID matches `sui-chain-id` and refuses to start on mismatch (see [1.4](#14-sui-rpc)), so a mismatched CLI config is the more common source of this error.

### 11.3 Registration and offline signing

The errors in this subsection are produced by **Sui tooling** (the `sui` CLI and the Sui framework), not by Hashi. Their exact wording is not verified against this repository and might differ in your version of the Sui CLI. The causes and fixes below are the Hashi-side explanation.

**Symptom:** registration is rejected with a message indicating the address is not an active or pending validator.

**Likely cause:** the transaction was sent from an address that is not in the Sui **active validator set**. Hashi's onchain registration asserts that the sender is an active Sui validator, so a fresh key, an operator key, or a validator that has not yet been activated cannot register.

**Fix:** sign and send the initial registration from the **Sui validator account key**, as described in [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key). The operator address goes in `--operator-address`; it is not the sender.

---

**Symptom:** `sui keytool sign` reports that no keystore entry was found for the given key identity.

**Likely cause:** `sui keytool sign` signs only with keys held in your local Sui keystore, and the validator account key is not in it. This is the normal situation, because that key usually lives in cold storage or on a hardware wallet.

**Fix:** this is expected, not a misconfiguration. The offline flow in [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key) deliberately separates the two steps: `hashi register --print-only` builds the unsigned transaction **without needing any private key**, and you then sign it wherever the key actually lives. Use `sui keytool sign` only if the account key genuinely is in your local keystore; otherwise produce the signature with your hardware wallet or multisig tooling and broadcast the result with `sui client execute-signed-tx`.

---

**Symptom:** a transaction fails reporting that no gas coins are owned by the address.

**Likely cause:** the sending address holds no SUI. For registration this is the validator account address; for day-to-day node operation it is the operator address.

**Fix:** fund the address. For the operator key specifically, fund it with **at least 2 SUI**. See the note in [2.4](#24-operator-key-day-to-day-signing) explaining why exactly 1 SUI is not enough and produces `InsufficientCoinBalance`.

---

**Symptom:** registration fails with a signer/sender mismatch.

**Likely cause:** the plain `hashi register` execute path signs with the configured operator key while forcing the sender to the validator address.

**Fix:** use `--print-only` and sign offline. This is covered in [2.3](#23-registration-must-be-signed-by-the-account-key).

### 11.4 Bitcoin light client (Kyoto)

The embedded light client logs its own messages under a `Kyoto:` prefix. Progress and percent-complete lines come from the light client library rather than from Hashi, so their exact wording is not guaranteed by this repository; use the `hashi_kyoto_sync_percent` metric from [8.3](#83-key-metrics) as the authoritative progress signal.

**Symptom:** sync progress sits at 0 and does not climb; `hashi_kyoto_synced` stays `0`.

**Likely cause:** the configured peer is reachable but is **not serving compact block filters**. The light client syncs through BIP-157/158 filters, so a peer without the filter index built and filter serving enabled cannot advance it, even though the JSON-RPC channel works fine.

**Fix:** confirm both settings are present in `bitcoin.conf` and that the node advertises the capability:

```bash
bitcoin-cli -signet getindexinfo      # basic block filter index must be present and synced
bitcoin-cli -signet getnetworkinfo    # NODE_COMPACT_FILTERS must be advertised
```

`blockfilterindex=1` builds the index and `peerblockfilters=1` serves it. **Both** are required, and adding them to an existing node triggers a one-time index build that must finish before sync progresses. See [1.5](#15-bitcoin-node).

---

**Symptom:** the log repeats:

```
Kyoto node exited cleanly; restarting
Kyoto node exited with error: ...; restarting
```

**Likely cause:** the light client lost all of its peers and its supervision loop is rebuilding it. Because the client runs in whitelist-only mode, it connects **only** to `bitcoin-trusted-peers` and cannot fall back to peer discovery. If every configured peer is unreachable, the node exits and is restarted with a short backoff.

**Fix:** verify each entry in `bitcoin-trusted-peers` is reachable from the Hashi host on its **P2P** port (38333 on Signet, not the RPC port 38332), and that the Bitcoin node has `listen=1`. Restarts are also expected, and harmless, whenever the Bitcoin node itself restarts. Watch `hashi_kyoto_restarts_total` to distinguish a one-off from a loop.

---

**Symptom:**

```
Lost connectivity to Bitcoin peers after 15 consecutive failures. Restarting Kyoto node...
```

**Likely cause:** 15 consecutive peer connection failures. Same root causes as above: wrong port, firewall, or a Bitcoin node that is down.

**Fix:** as above. `hashi_kyoto_consecutive_failures` shows the count climbing toward this threshold, so it gives earlier warning than the restart message.

---

**Symptom:** the node fails to start with `Invalid bitcoin peer '<value>': expected 'host:port' format`.

**Likely cause:** an entry in `bitcoin-trusted-peers` omits the port. The port is **mandatory**; there is no default.

**Fix:** `bitcoin-trusted-peers = ["127.0.0.1:38333"]`.

---

**Symptom:** connected peer count is low but stable, for example `1`.

**Likely cause:** this is normal. See the explanation in [8.3](#83-key-metrics): the count is bounded by the number of entries in `bitcoin-trusted-peers`.

**Fix:** none needed. Alert on `== 0`, not on a low count.

---

**Symptom:** `hashi_kyoto_best_height` stays at `0` and the log repeats:

```
Waiting for bitcoind to reach start height 300000; it is at 214173
```

**Likely cause:** the light client anchors at `bitcoin-start-height` and cannot start until your Bitcoin node has that block. Either the node is still syncing, or the height is past its tip.

**Fix:** none needed while the node is syncing — the height in the log climbs, and Hashi anchors and carries on by itself once it arrives, with no restart. If the height is not climbing, set `bitcoin-start-height` at or below your node's tip, as noted in [1.5](#15-bitcoin-node).

## 12. Coming soon

The following capabilities are planned but not yet available.

### Metrics push service

> **Coming soon:** A centralized metrics push service, to push Prometheus metrics to a shared endpoint for aggregate monitoring.

### Cloud backup integration

> **Coming soon:** Support for automatically uploading encrypted backups to cloud storage (for example, S3).

---

## 13. Testnet releases

Testnet releases are available at [github.com/MystenLabs/hashi/releases](https://github.com/MystenLabs/hashi/releases). Each release is labeled `Hashi testnet <short-sha>` and tagged `testnet-<full-sha>`.

### 13.1 Binary

Download `hashi-linux-amd64` and `SHA256SUMS` from the same release into one directory. Verify that the binary's SHA-256 matches the checksum published with the release:

```bash
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
```

The command must print `hashi-linux-amd64: OK`. Do not run the binary if the check fails. The computed hash can also be inspected directly and compared with the binary SHA-256 shown in the release notes:

```bash
sha256sum hashi-linux-amd64
```

After the hash matches, verify that GitHub Actions produced the binary and make it executable:

```bash
gh attestation verify hashi-linux-amd64 --repo MystenLabs/hashi
chmod +x hashi-linux-amd64
```

### 13.2 Container image

The matching public image uses the same release tag:

```bash
docker pull mysten/hashi:testnet-<full-sha>
```

The release notes include the image's immutable OCI digest. Pin that digest when a deployment must remain on the exact image regardless of tags:

```text
mysten/hashi@sha256:<digest>
```

### 13.3 Rolling the Mysten Testnet nodes

The six Mysten validators (`mysten1`–`mysten6`) are single-replica Deployments in namespace `hashi-testnet` on `workloads-secondary-use4`, managed by the `mysten/testnet` stack of `pulumi/services/hashi-server` in sui-operations. Each mounts a ReadWriteOnce PVC, which is why the Deployments use the `Recreate` strategy — never switch them back to `RollingUpdate`; a surge pod would double-mount the DB volume.

Set `hashi-server:image.image_ref` to the release sha in `pulumi/services/hashi-server/Pulumi.testnet.yaml` (land it as a PR), then roll **one node at a time**:

```bash
cd pulumi/services/hashi-server && pulumi stack select mysten/testnet

# For each N in 1..6, in order:
pulumi up --yes --target "urn:pulumi:testnet::hashi-server::kubernetes:apps/v1:Deployment::mysten<N>"
kubectl -n hashi-testnet rollout status deploy/mysten<N> --timeout=600s
kubectl -n hashi-testnet logs deploy/mysten<N> | grep -m1 "Guardian bootstrap complete"
```

Proceed to the next node only after all three checks pass. If a node does not come back healthy, stop and investigate before touching the next — every additional node down eats into the committee's 2/3 signing margin (§9).

Rollout gotchas:

- **Serialize the updates.** Wait for each `pulumi up` to exit before starting the next; concurrent targeted ups conflict on the stack lock (409).
- **Don't trust the pod label for readiness.** `kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -l hashi-node=mysten<N>` also matches the still-terminating old pod.
- **Unhealthy fleet, different gates.** Mid-incident (for example a reconfiguration stall, §9.3) no pod turns Ready, so `rollout status` never completes and pulumi's readiness await reports the Deployment as errored even though the image update applied. Gate on the pod reaching `Running` with no restarts plus the guardian bootstrap log line, and re-run the targeted `pulumi up` after recovery to reconcile state.
