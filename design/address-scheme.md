# Bitcoin Address Scheme

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> Hashi derives a unique Bitcoin Taproot deposit address for every Sui address using a 2-of-2 multisig between the MPC committee and the Guardian, plus a delayed MPC-only recovery path.

Every Sui address has its own unique Hashi Bitcoin deposit address. This gives
Hashi a lightweight way to identify which Sui address to credit for a deposit.
All Hashi deposit addresses are `P2TR` (Pay-to-Taproot) with a Taproot tree of
two leaves:

1. A 2-of-2 multisig script between Hashi and the Guardian, used for all
   normal spends.
2. A recovery script that lets the Hashi key alone spend the output after a
   60-day BIP-68 relative timelock enforced by `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`
   (BIP-112). This is an
   escape hatch: if the Guardian key is ever lost, funds become recoverable by
   the MPC committee once the delay elapses. The delay is measured from when
   the UTXO confirms and is baked into the script, so changing it changes
   every deposit address.

The exact [descriptor](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)
is:

```
tr({i}, {multi_a(2, {g}, {h}), and_v(v:older({delay}), pk({h}))})
```

where:

- `H` is the base Hashi MPC public key, available onchain.
- `h = derive(H, d)` is the child public key derived from `H` using
  derivation path `d` (the depositor's Sui address).
- `g` is the guardian's fixed public key.
- `delay` is the 60-day relative timelock, encoded as the BIP-68 sequence
  `0x0040278D` (`4_204_429`): the time-based type bit (`1 << 22`) OR'd with
  `10_125` (= `ceil(60 * 24 * 60 * 60 / 512)`, the count of 512-second units
  in 60 days).
- `i` is the NUMS (nothing-up-my-sleeve) internal key defined in BIP-341
  (`50929b74c1a04954b78b4b6035e97a5e078a5a0f28ec96d547bfee9ace803ac0`)
  with no known private key, ensuring all spends occur through the script path.

The key derivation is not BIP-32. It is a purpose-built unhardened derivation
over secp256k1, keyed by the Sui address, giving each depositor a unique
Bitcoin address while the master signing key remains shared across the MPC
committee.
