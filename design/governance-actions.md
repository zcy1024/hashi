# Governance Actions

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> Proposal types that the Hashi committee uses to upgrade packages, enable or disable versions, and update onchain configuration.

Governance actions are each defined by a unique `Proposal<T>` type. Proposals
adjust protocol parameters, pause or unpause operations, or perform sensitive
operations like package upgrades. Only members of the current Hashi committee
can create proposals. Each proposal type has its own threshold, which a quorum
of validators must reach by voting in support of the proposal.

The following is the current set of available proposal types.

## `Upgrade`

Authorizes a package upgrade.

## `EnableVersion`

Re-enables a previously disabled package version, allowing the protocol to use
it again.

## `DisableVersion`

Disables a package version, preventing it from being used. The currently
active version cannot be disabled, to avoid bricking the protocol.

## `UpdateConfig`

Updates a protocol configuration parameter by key. Supports any config
key-value pair (for example, deposit fee, rate limits). See
[Configuration](config.mdx) for the full list of keys and defaults.

## `EmergencyPause`

Pauses or unpauses deposit and withdrawal processing by setting the `paused`
config flag. The two directions use different vote thresholds: pausing is
deliberately cheap (`governance_emergency_pause_threshold_bps`, default 5% of
committee weight) so a small fraction of the committee can quickly halt the
system, while unpausing requires a supermajority
(`governance_emergency_unpause_threshold_bps`, default two thirds).

## `UpdateGuardian`

Updates the guardian's URL in the global config. Only the URL is governable:
the guardian's BTC public key is immutable once set, because rotating it would
invalidate derived deposit addresses.

## `AbortReconfig`

Aborts a pending reconfiguration for a specific epoch, clearing the pending
epoch change and removing the pending committee. Voted on by the **current**
committed committee, which is the only committee with stable onchain voting
power if the pending committee cannot complete DKG or key rotation. See
[Reconfiguration](reconfiguration.mdx) for when and how this is used.
