# Governance Actions

> Proposal types that the Hashi committee uses to upgrade packages, enable or disable versions, and update onchain configuration.

Governance actions are each defined by a unique `Proposal<T>` type. Proposals
adjust protocol parameters, pause or unpause operations, or perform sensitive
operations like package upgrades. Only members of the current Hashi committee
can create proposals. Each proposal type has its own threshold, which a quorum
of validators must reach by voting in support of the proposal. Creating a
proposal casts the creator's vote. Quorum is counted against the committee in
office when the proposal executes, so votes from members who left at a
reconfiguration no longer count. A proposal expires seven days after it is
created; it can then no longer be voted on or executed, and anyone can delete
it. Executed proposals stay onchain.

The following is the current set of available proposal types.

## `Upgrade`

Authorizes a package upgrade and records whether it is exclusive. An exclusive
upgrade atomically disables all previous versions as the new package is
committed; a non-exclusive upgrade deliberately leaves them callable. Every
upgrade must make this classification explicitly. See
[Move Package Upgrades](move-upgrades.mdx) for the decision criteria and
validator rollout contract.

## `EnableVersion`

Re-enables a previously disabled package version, allowing the protocol to use
it again.

## `DisableVersion`

Disables a package version, preventing it from being used. A version cannot
disable itself: executing the proposal through package version N refuses to
disable N (`EDisableCurrentVersion`). To disable a broken new version, execute
through an older version that is still enabled.

## `UpdateConfig`

Updates existing parameters in the instant config by key; the new values apply
when the proposal executes. Every entry is validated when the proposal is
created and again when it executes, and the whole proposal aborts if any entry
fails: the key must already exist in the store with a value of the same type
(`EInvalidConfigEntry`), and the key must be governable. The guardian BTC
public key and the Bitcoin chain id are pinned for the deployment's lifetime
and cannot be written through any config proposal (`EProtectedConfigKey`).
Values themselves are otherwise not bounded onchain: a proposal needs a
supermajority of committee weight, and reviewing the proposed value is part of
voting. See [Configuration](config.mdx) for the keys and defaults.

The guardian's URLs are changed through this proposal as well, with entries
that set `guardian_url` (the public endpoint) or `guardian_node_url` (the
endpoint nodes call) to a new string value. The URLs are the only guardian
settings governance can change: the guardian's BTC public key is immutable
once set, because rotating it would invalidate derived deposit addresses.
Executing the proposal changes the onchain value, but a running node keeps the
guardian client it already resolved from `guardian_node_url`, so each node must
be restarted before it calls a new node URL. Nodes do not read
`guardian_url`.

## `UpdateEpochConfig`

Updates existing parameters in the epoch config by key, including the MPC
parameters, which must pass their range check (`EInvalidConfigEntry`). At
execution, `mpc_weight_reduction_allowed_delta` must also end up below
`mpc_max_faulty_in_basis_points` (`EInconsistentMpcConfig`). The new
values are copied onto the next committee formed after execution; the active
committee keeps its pinned copy. The pinned keys are refused here as well.

## `AddConfig`

Introduces new keys into the instant or epoch config, which is how a node-side
setting becomes governable without a package upgrade. The proposal is
insert-only: a key already present in the target store aborts, and the first
value fixes the key's type for later updates. The pinned key names cannot be
introduced into either store.

## `IgnoreMember`

Flags a registered member as ignored, or clears the flag. The next committee
formed leaves an ignored member out, so its weight drops out of every
threshold from then on; the current committee is never altered, and if a
reconfiguration is already pending the change lands one epoch later. The
member stays registered (an ignored member cannot be removed as inactive), and
the same proposal type with the flag cleared re-admits it.

## `EmergencyPause`

Pauses or unpauses the bridge by setting the `paused` config flag. While
paused, the chain refuses new deposit and withdrawal requests and every
committee step that processes them; users can still cancel withdrawal
requests, and reconfiguration and governance keep running. The two directions
use different vote thresholds: pausing is deliberately cheap
(`governance_emergency_pause_threshold_bps`, default 5% of committee weight)
so a small fraction of the committee can quickly halt the system, while
unpausing requires a supermajority
(`governance_emergency_unpause_threshold_bps`, default two thirds). `paused`
is also an ordinary config key, so an `UpdateConfig` proposal can set or clear
it at the two-thirds threshold.

Aborting a stuck reconfiguration is deliberately **not** a proposal: the
committees that could vote on one are the parties a stalled reconfiguration
puts in doubt. It is a permissionless entry function gated on onchain state
instead; see [Abort Reconfig](reconfiguration.mdx#abort-reconfig). Holding
off the replacement that would otherwise follow is an `UpdateConfig` setting
[`reconfig_hold`](config.mdx#reconfig_hold), passed by the committee that is
still in service.
