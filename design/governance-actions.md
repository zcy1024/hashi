# Governance Actions

> Proposal types that the Hashi committee uses to upgrade packages, enable or disable versions, and update onchain configuration.

Governance actions are each defined by a unique `Proposal<T>` type. Proposals
adjust protocol parameters, pause or unpause operations, or perform sensitive
operations like package upgrades. Only members of the current Hashi committee
can create proposals. Each proposal type has its own threshold, which a quorum
of validators must reach by voting in support of the proposal.

The following is the current set of available proposal types.

## `Upgrade`

Authorizes a package upgrade and records whether it is exclusive. An exclusive
upgrade atomically disables all previous versions as the new package is
committed; a non-exclusive upgrade deliberately leaves them callable. Every
upgrade must make this classification explicitly. See
[Move Package Upgrades](move-upgrades.mdx) for the decision criteria and
validator rollout contract.

## `EnableVersion`

Re-enables a previously disabled package version, allowing the protocol to use
it again.

## `DisableVersion`

Disables a package version, preventing it from being used. The currently
active version cannot be disabled, to avoid bricking the protocol.

## `UpdateConfig`

Updates existing parameters in the instant config by key; the new values apply
when the proposal executes. Every entry is validated when the proposal
executes, and the whole proposal aborts if any entry fails: the key must
already exist in the store with a value of the same type
(`EInvalidConfigEntry`), and the key must be governable. The guardian BTC
public key and the Bitcoin chain id are pinned for the deployment's lifetime
and cannot be written through any config proposal (`EProtectedConfigKey`).
Values themselves are otherwise not bounded onchain: a proposal needs a
supermajority of committee weight, and reviewing the proposed value is part of
voting. See [Configuration](config.mdx) for the keys and defaults.

## `UpdateEpochConfig`

Updates existing parameters in the epoch config by key, including the MPC
parameters, which must pass their range check (`EInvalidConfigEntry`). The new
values are copied onto the next committee formed after execution; the active
committee keeps its pinned copy. The pinned keys are refused here as well.

## `AddConfig`

Introduces new keys into the instant or epoch config, which is how a node-side
setting becomes governable without a package upgrade. The proposal is
insert-only: a key already present in the target store aborts, and the first
value fixes the key's type for later updates. The pinned key names cannot be
introduced into either store.

## `EmergencyPause`

Pauses or unpauses deposit and withdrawal processing by setting the `paused`
config flag. The two directions use different vote thresholds: pausing is
deliberately cheap (`governance_emergency_pause_threshold_bps`, default 5% of
committee weight) so a small fraction of the committee can quickly halt the
system, while unpausing requires a supermajority
(`governance_emergency_unpause_threshold_bps`, default two thirds).

## `UpdateGuardian`

Updates the guardian's URL in the global config. Only the URL is governable:
the guardian's BTC public key is immutable once set, because rotating it would
invalidate derived deposit addresses.

Aborting a stuck reconfiguration is deliberately **not** a proposal: the
committees that could vote on one are the parties a stalled reconfiguration
puts in doubt. It is a permissionless entry function gated on onchain state
instead; see [Abort Reconfig](reconfiguration.mdx#abort-reconfig). Holding
off the replacement that would otherwise follow is an `UpdateConfig` setting
[`reconfig_hold`](config.mdx#reconfig_hold), passed by the committee that is
still in service.
