# Move Package Upgrades

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> How Hashi classifies Move upgrades as exclusive or non-exclusive, rolls out validator binaries, and retires old package versions safely.

Hashi package versions are separate callable Sui packages, but they operate on
the same shared `Hashi` object. Publishing a new package therefore does not make
an old package harmless. If an old entry function interprets shared state using
an obsolete invariant, it can overwrite or destroy work performed by the new
version.

The withdrawal v2 work exposed a concrete example. A request committed by v2
could remain in a location that v1 treated as cancellable. While v1 remained
enabled, its cancellation path could destroy that committed request, stranding
burned hBTC and locked UTXOs. This is why package publication and version
retirement sometimes need to be one atomic governance action.

## Required classification

Every upgrade proposal must be labeled **exclusive** or **non-exclusive** in
its design and rollout plan. Reviewers should treat a missing classification as
an incomplete upgrade.

Use an **exclusive upgrade** when any of the following is true:

- The new version changes the meaning, location, or lifecycle of shared state.
- An old entry function could undo, overwrite, replay, or misclassify a new
  version's write.
- Safety depends on all callers using the new validation or authorization rule.
- Cross-version behavior has not been tested directly.

Exclusive should be the default when there is doubt. It atomically replaces the
enabled-version set with the newly committed version, so no transaction can
observe the new version enabled while an older version is still callable.

Use a **non-exclusive upgrade** only when retaining an older version is an
intentional compatibility feature. The review must explain why old and new
entry functions are safe against the same shared state and include direct
cross-version tests for state both versions can mutate. A desire to let old
validator binaries keep working is not, by itself, enough: binary rollout is an
operational concern and must not weaken an onchain safety invariant.

The `upgrade::Upgrade` proposal records this decision in its `exclusive`
field. Execution returns the Sui `UpgradeTicket` together with a non-droppable
authorization carrying the approved setting. Finalization consumes both in the
same programmable transaction, binding the committee vote to the version policy
that is applied when the package is committed. The CLI requires
`--exclusive true` or `--exclusive false`; omission is rejected so the
classification cannot be an accidental default.

## Validator rollout contract

An exclusive upgrade deliberately makes old binaries unable to perform normal
writes once the upgrade checkpoint is observed. An old binary does not contain
the code or ABI routing for the newest package, and the previous package is no
longer enabled. Updated Hashi nodes detect that they support no enabled package
version and halt autonomous mutations instead of falling back unsafely.

Use this sequence for every upgrade:

1. Build the exact Move package and record its digest in the proposal. Create
   exclusive proposals with `--package-path`, which verifies the package's
   `PACKAGE_VERSION` constant against the chain before proposing; the CLI
   refuses `--digest` for an exclusive upgrade unless
   `--allow-unverified-exclusive` explicitly acknowledges that the constant
   was not machine-checked.
2. Release a node binary that understands both the currently active package and
   the proposed package.
3. Restart validators one at a time. Each validator verifies healthy operation
   on the current package before casting its vote.
4. Confirm that upgraded validators represent at least two thirds of committee
   **weight**, not merely two thirds of node count.
5. Reach proposal quorum, then separately execute and publish the upgrade with
   `hashi proposal execute-upgrade <proposal-id> --package-path <dir>`, built
   from the same commit and `sui` binary as the proposal's digest. Votes never
   auto-publish a package.
6. Verify the package-upgrade checkpoint, enabled-version set, active routing,
   and validator health before resuming ordinary rollout work.

This ordering means the network retains quorum-capable updated software before
an exclusive publication causes old binaries to stop writing.

## Current testnet v1 to v2 plan

The deployed testnet v1 package only has the legacy `upgrade` proposal. That
proposal always leaves previous versions enabled, so it cannot make the first
v1-to-v2 transition atomic. Testnet carries no real funds, and we accept a small
race window for this one migration. Run the migration under the emergency
pause, which closes the withdrawal-replay surface described below; the
withdrawal queue does not need to drain first.

1. Create and fully vote the pause, v2 upgrade, and `DisableVersion(1)`
   proposals while v1 is active. Proposal creation permits targeting the
   current version; only execution rejects disabling it.
2. Execute the pause once the remaining proposals are near quorum. Governance
   entries are not pause-gated, so the remaining steps execute while paused.
3. Verify the bridge is still paused, then execute, publish, and finalize v2
   through the legacy v1 upgrade path (`hashi proposal execute-upgrade`).
4. Wait for that transaction to succeed and obtain the newly published v2
   package ID.
5. Immediately execute the already-approved disable-v1 proposal through the v2
   package. Pre-build this transaction so only the package ID needs filling.
6. Verify that v1 calls fail with `EVersionDisabled` and that validators route
   ordinary work through v2.
7. Create, vote, and execute the unpause.

Proposal execution checks only quorum, not the caller, so any quorum-complete
proposal is executable by any account. The strict ordering therefore votes the
unpause only after `DisableVersion(1)` is verified: a pre-voted unpause would
let an adversary unpause and commit through v2 in one transaction inside the
window. The Testnet migration relaxes this and pre-votes the unpause
alongside the other proposals, accepting the theoretical window: nothing of
value is at stake, the window is seconds wide, and the proposing operators
have executed every proposal to date. Any future migration that carries real
value must use the strict ordering; on Mainnet the question should not arise
at all, because exclusive upgrades replace the enabled set atomically and
leave no window to protect.

The upgrade and disable are necessarily two transactions. Do not submit them
concurrently: the network does not guarantee shared-object ordering, and
disable-v1 must execute through v2 after publication.

The pause is what makes the window between them safe for withdrawals.
Commitment and approval certificates bind no package version, so while both
versions are enabled a live certificate can be replayed through v2's
`commit_withdrawal_tx`. That commits the request in place, where v1's
pause-exempt `cancel_withdrawal` (which checks only the `processed` bag) can
destroy it, burning the user's hBTC while releasing no BTC and wedging the
referencing withdrawal transaction forever. Every corrupting interleaving
requires such a v2 commit to land while v1 is still enabled.
`commit_withdrawal_tx` and `approve_request` honor the pause in both
packages, so holding the pause across the window means no transaction can
create that state, and the pause-exempt v1 cancel has nothing corruptible to
act on. In-flight withdrawals ride
through the flip without draining: committed batches sign, confirm, and
archive from their v1 locations, and approved or requested entries commit
v2-style afterward.

The pre-mainnet tree ships this way already: the legacy module is deleted,
the atomic proposal type is named `upgrade`, and it is the only upgrade path.
Mainnet begins with it from genesis.
