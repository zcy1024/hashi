> How the Hashi committee transfers MPC key shares between epochs through DKG or key rotation as Sui validators change.

Reconfiguration is one of the most important parts of the Hashi protocol,
because it is the step where the old committee shares key shares of the MPC
key with the new committee.

The Hashi service monitors the Sui epoch change and immediately starts Hashi
reconfiguration after Sui's epoch change completes. During reconfiguration,
in-progress operations (for example, processing of withdrawals) are paused.
The new committee resumes and processes them after reconfiguration completes.

### Start Reconfig

```mermaid

```

Each Hashi node monitors Sui for epoch changes. When a new Sui epoch is
detected and the Hashi epoch has not yet advanced to match, the node knows
that a reconfiguration is needed. A committee member submits an onchain
transaction by calling `hashi::reconfig::start_reconfig` to signal that
reconfiguration should begin for the target epoch:

```move
entry fun start_reconfig(
    self: &mut Hashi,
    sui_system: &SuiSystemState,
    ctx: &TxContext,
)
```

This sets a pending epoch change flag in the onchain state, which pauses
normal operations (deposits, withdrawals) until reconfiguration completes.
The new committee membership is determined by the set of validators that
registered with Hashi for the new epoch. Stake weights come from the Sui
validator set.

At genesis (when no MPC public key exists yet), the **launch switch**
additionally gates `start_reconfig`: it aborts until the publisher
has sent `hashi::finish_publish` (the `hashi launch` CLI command), which
finalizes the deploy configuration and hands the package `UpgradeCap` into
onchain custody. This gives the publisher explicit control over when (and
with which registered validators) the initial committee forms. After genesis
Hashi never consults the gate; it follows Sui's validator set
unconditionally, because a floor on a normal reconfig would let validators
brick reconfiguration by withholding registration.

### DKG or Key Rotation

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Reconfig] --> B[DKG or Key Rotation]:::active --> C[End Reconfig]
    classDef active fill:#298DFF,stroke:#1759C4,color:#FFFFFF
```

The MPC key protocol runs among the new committee members. Which protocol
runs depends on whether this is the first Hashi epoch or a subsequent one:

- **Initial DKG**: if there is no existing MPC public key (the genesis epoch),
  the committee runs the distributed key generation protocol to produce a
  fresh master key.
- **Key rotation**: if an MPC public key already exists, the old committee's
  key shares are redistributed to the new committee. The old committee
  members act as dealers and the new committee members act as receivers.

In both cases, the output is a `DkgOutput` containing the new committee's
key shares and the MPC public key. See [MPC Protocol](mpc-protocol.mdx)
for details.

Each committee member then signs a `ReconfigCompletionMessage` containing
the target epoch and the MPC public key using their BLS12-381 key. Nodes
collect signatures from each other through RPC until a quorum (2/3 of
committee weight) is reached, producing a BLS aggregate signature certificate.
This ensures that a supermajority of the new committee agrees on the key
protocol output before the epoch transition is finalized onchain.

### End Reconfig

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Reconfig] --> B[DKG or Key Rotation] --> C[End Reconfig]:::active
    classDef active fill:#298DFF,stroke:#1759C4,color:#FFFFFF
```

A committee member submits the aggregate signature certificate onchain by
calling `hashi::reconfig::end_reconfig`:

```move
entry fun end_reconfig(
    self: &mut Hashi,
    mpc_public_key: vector<u8>,
    mpc_cert: CommitteeSignature,
    ctx: &TxContext,
)
```

The onchain contract verifies the certificate, commits the generated MPC
public key if DKG ran (or verifies that the key remains unchanged from the
previous epoch), advances the Hashi epoch, and clears the pending epoch
change flag.

Completion must land inside the Sui epoch the reconfiguration was formed in.
`start_reconfig` pins the pending committee to Sui's epoch, and both
`submit_committee_handoff` and `end_reconfig` abort with
`EReconfigWindowClosed` once Sui's epoch has moved past it; from then on only
[abort reconfig](#abort-reconfig) can resolve the pending state. Each
submission is bound to its target. `end_reconfig` reads it from the
completion certificate's signing epoch; `submit_committee_handoff` takes it
as an explicit `epoch` argument, because the handoff certificate is signed by
the outgoing committee and its signing epoch is the source epoch. The signed
handoff message already binds the target, so the argument adds no security;
it lets the chain name the failure. Both entries abort with
`EWrongReconfigEpoch` when a different epoch is pending (the target was
aborted and a replacement has formed), before any signature is checked. A
submission whose own target already activated is reported as
`EReconfigAlreadyCompleted` (another node's `end_reconfig` won the race, which
the node treats as success), whether or not the next reconfiguration is
already pending; nothing pending otherwise is `ENotReconfiguring` (the target
was aborted). Handoffs are stored by source epoch, and a replacement can form
from the same source epoch after an abort, so for a handoff "own target" means
the stored handoff out of its signing epoch names the submitted `epoch`. Nodes
key their retry-or-give-up decision on which of these fires.

After the new epoch begins, the new committee initializes the signing state
for the epoch by running the presigning protocol to generate a batch of
presignatures needed for the threshold Schnorr signing protocol (see
[MPC Protocol](mpc-protocol.mdx)). After presignatures are ready, normal
operations resume for processing deposits and withdrawals.

### Abort Reconfig

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Start Reconfig] --> B[DKG or Key Rotation] --> C[Abort Reconfig]:::active
    C --> A
    classDef active fill:#298DFF,stroke:#1759C4,color:#FFFFFF
```

Reconfiguration can fail after `start_reconfig` has committed the pending
committee but before `end_reconfig` can safely advance the Hashi epoch.
Examples include:

- The pending committee cannot complete initial DKG because too much
  registered stake is offline or misconfigured.
- Key rotation cannot complete because the old committee cannot supply enough
  valid resharing material to the new committee.
- The new committee completes the MPC protocol but cannot gather a threshold
  BLS certificate over a single `ReconfigCompletionMessage`.
- The MPC output is inconsistent with the onchain invariant that the threshold
  public key remains unchanged across key-rotation epochs.
- A bad pending committee was formed from stale or incorrect validator
  metadata, such as invalid endpoint, TLS, BLS, or encryption key updates.

In these cases, anyone can call the `reconfig::abort_reconfig` entry function
directly, naming the pending epoch to abort. It is deliberately not a
governance proposal and takes no vote: the committees that could vote on one
are exactly the parties a stalled reconfiguration puts in doubt. The pending
committee may never finish DKG or key rotation, and a proposal gated on the
outgoing committee's quorum can be stranded by the same offline stake that
stalled the reconfiguration. Instead the abort is bound to objective onchain
conditions, all checked in the same transaction:

1. A reconfiguration is in progress, i.e. a pending epoch change exists, and
   the named epoch is the pending one (a stale transaction cannot tear down a
   different reconfiguration).
2. The pending epoch is not Sui's current epoch. `start_reconfig` pins the
   pending committee's epoch to Sui's epoch at formation time, so while the
   two still match the reconfiguration is inside its window and may
   legitimately complete. Only once Sui's epoch has moved past the target is
   the reconfiguration stuck by definition: [end reconfig](#end-reconfig)
   refuses to land after the window, so completion and abort are mutually
   exclusive by Sui epoch and can never race each other.

The launch switch is not re-checked: a pending genesis committee can only
exist because `start_reconfig` passed it, and the package `UpgradeCap` it
looks for never leaves onchain custody.

When these hold, the call clears the pending epoch change, removes the pending
committee (discarding any committee handoff certificate it had collected), and
emits `ReconfigAborted` with the aborted epoch. The current Hashi epoch,
committee, and MPC public key remain unchanged. After genesis, normal
operations resume under the last committed committee; at genesis there is no
committee yet, so Hashi returns to its pre-genesis state. Either way the Hashi
epoch now lags Sui's, and a fresh `start_reconfig` forms a replacement
committee from the then-current validator set.

Nodes drive this themselves. When a node sees a checkpoint from a later Sui
epoch while a reconfiguration is still pending, it stops working on that
reconfiguration, submits the abort (the chain settles the race between nodes),
and submits the replacement `start_reconfig` as soon as the abort is
reflected. A node that observes an abort it did not submit, including one an
operator sent by hand with `hashi committee abort-reconfig`, starts the
replacement in the same way, as does a node that comes up to find Hashi's
epoch behind Sui's with nothing pending, whether or not it can rebuild its
own signing state for the lagging epoch. The CLI commands are therefore
fallbacks for when no node is doing this: `abort-reconfig` refuses up front
when nothing is pending or the pending epoch is still Sui's current epoch,
and `hashi committee start-reconfig` submits the replacement, refusing when
a reconfiguration is pending or Hashi is already on Sui's current epoch.

Governance can hold the replacement off. While the
[`reconfig_hold`](config.mdx#reconfig_hold) config flag is set through an
`UpdateConfig` proposal, `start_reconfig` aborts on chain, so no committee
can form and the last committed committee keeps serving deposits and
withdrawals; nodes see the flag and do not submit. A reconfiguration already
pending is unaffected, and so is `abort_reconfig`, so the sequence for staying
on the last committed committee is to set the flag and then let the overrun
reconfiguration be aborted. Clearing the flag does not itself start a
replacement: nodes submit `start_reconfig` on a Sui epoch change, on an abort,
and at startup, and none of those is a config change, so the replacement waits
for the next Sui epoch change unless an operator runs
`hashi committee start-reconfig`.

Every abort observed on chain, whoever submitted it, increments the node
metric `hashi_reconfig_aborted_total`. An abort means a reconfiguration
stalled for an entire Sui epoch with deposits and withdrawals halted, so it is
worth alerting on and investigating even though the system recovers on its
own.
