# Hashi Node Backups

*[Documentation index](/hashi/design/llms.txt) · [Full index](/hashi/design/llms-full.txt)*

> How node operators encrypt and restore essential node data with armored PGP backups, including YubiKey restore paths.

Hashi automatically backs up the data a node needs to rejoin the committee after
data loss. Every epoch, Hashi writes the node config, referenced key files,
and database snapshot to a tar archive, then compresses and encrypts it as an
ASCII-armored PGP message. The backup files use the suffix `.tar.asc`.

Encryption only needs the public PGP certificate, so the backup key does not
need to be present on the server during normal operation. Restore needs access
to the matching private key, either as a local PGP secret-key file or through
`gpg-agent` for YubiKey-backed keys. Because `gpg-agent` can be forwarded over
SSH, you can restore on a remote server using a YubiKey plugged into your laptop
instead of plugging the YubiKey into the server itself.

## Create a backup Key

### Option 1: Create a private key on a YubiKey (recommended)

We recommend generating a PGP private key entirely on a YubiKey, and using its
public key to encrypt the node backup. This makes it practically impossible for
anyone to decrypt the backup without physical access to the YubiKey. The risk
is that you will also be unable to decrypt the backup if you lose access to the
YubiKey. To minimize this risk, we recommend obtaining at least two YubiKeys and
repeating the procedure for each.

For the initial YubiKey setup, you must use a machine with a physical USB port.
After initial setup, you can encrypt the share to the public key of the YubiKey
on any machine, including a cloud server without a USB port.

1. Obtain a new [YubiKey 5 Series](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/).
   There are six models: the YubiKey 5C NFC, 5 NFC, 5C, 5 Nano, 5C Nano, and
   5CI. Any of these models works, though avoid the Nano models because they are
   smaller and easier to lose.

2. Install tools on the USB-capable machine:
   - [oct](https://codeberg.org/openpgp-card/openpgp-card-tools), OpenPGP card tools.
   - [gpg](https://gnupg.org/), for testing decryption.

3. Insert a YubiKey and confirm it is visible. **Make sure no other YubiKeys or
   smartcards are plugged into the machine.**

```sh
$ oct list
```

You will see something like this:

```
Available OpenPGP cards:
0006:26883270
```

4. Save the card id and a filename for the public key:

```sh
CARD=$(oct list --idents-only | head -n1)
CARD_FILE="yubikey-public-$(echo "$CARD" | tr ':' '-').asc"
echo "$CARD"
echo "$CARD_FILE"
```

5. Change default PINs

The User PIN is used for daily cryptographic operations like decryption; the
Admin PIN is used for card configuration such as generating/importing keys.

The default PINs for new YubiKeys are:
User PIN:  123456
Admin PIN: 12345678

PINs can contain numbers, letters, and symbols (despite the name), and must be
6, 7, or 8 characters long.

Determine a new user and admin key for the YubiKey. These PINs are essential. If
you lose them, you cannot decrypt the node backups. Back up the PINs in a safe
place, such as a company password manager. Do not use the default PINs.

Change the PINs with the following commands. You will first be prompted to enter
the current (default) PIN, then prompted to enter the new PIN twice.

```sh
oct pin --card "$CARD" set-user
oct pin --card "$CARD" set-admin
```

6. Confirm the YubiKey does not already contain keys:

```sh
oct status --card "$CARD"
```

Confirm the Signature, Decryption, and Authentication key slots do not show
fingerprints. **If the card already has keys, stop here!**

7. Generate the PGP key on the YubiKey.

**This overwrites any existing keys on the YubiKey. Existing keys cannot be
recovered after they are overwritten. Any files encrypted to the old public
key will become permanently undecryptable!**

You will be prompted to enter both the new user and new admin PINs. Be sure to
update the name and email to real values. The public key will be saved to the
output file.

```sh
oct admin --card "$CARD" generate \
  --userid "Your Name <you@example.com>" \
  --output "$CARD_FILE" \
  curve25519
```

8. Repeat the above steps for any additional YubiKeys.

9. Test encrypting a file to each YubiKey's public key. Import the public key,
   then encrypt a test file:

```sh
gpg --import "$CARD_FILE"
```

```sh
echo "test message" > test.txt
gpg --encrypt --armor \
  --trust-model always \
  --recipient "you@example.com" \
  --output test.txt.asc \
  test.txt
```

10. Test decrypting the file with the YubiKey. With the YubiKey plugged in,
   link the card to gpg, then decrypt. You will be prompted for the User PIN,
   and to tap the YubiKey.

```sh
gpg --card-status
```

```sh
gpg --decrypt test.txt.asc
```

You may see a warning like `cipher algorithm AES not found in recipient
preferences`. You can ignore this. It happens because the public key exported by
`oct` does not include the cipher preferences that `gpg` expects, so `gpg` warns
even though encryption and decryption still work.

Confirm the output matches the original file contents, then delete the test
files.

11. Store the YubiKeys in a secure location, such as a company safe. Also save
   the public key files in a secure location.

### Option 2: Create a local private key file

If you do not want to use a YubiKey, you can generate a PGP private key locally
and encrypt with it. Because the private key is stored in a normal file instead
of on a YubiKey, there is a greater risk of unauthorized use of the private key.
Store the file carefully.

1. Install tools:
   - [sequoia-sq](https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia-sq), Sequoia PGP.

2. Generate a new key pair. Be sure to update the name and email to real
values.

```sh
sq key generate \
  --own-key \
  --name "Your Name" \
  --email "you@example.com" \
  --expiration never \
  --without-password \
  --output private-key.asc \
  --rev-cert revocation-cert.asc
```

3. Export the public key to a file. Note that despite the name, this doesn't
   actually delete the private key, it just extracts the public key.

```sh
sq key delete \
  --cert-file private-key.asc \
  --output public-key.asc
```

4. Test encrypting a file to the public key:

```sh
echo "test message" > test.txt
sq encrypt \
  --for-file public-key.asc \
  --without-signature \
  --output test.txt.asc \
  test.txt
```

5. Test decrypting the file with the private key:

```sh
sq decrypt --recipient-file private-key.asc test.txt.asc
```

Confirm the output matches the original file contents, then delete the test
files.

6. Save the revocation, public key, and private key files in a secure location.

## Configuring hashi

To enable automatic backups using the new PGP public key, add the public cert to
the node config file under the field `backup-pgp-cert`.

You can also configure the location where Hashi saves backups with the field
`backup-dir`.

## Cloud backup

In the future, we will likely add support for automatically uploading backups
to cloud storage such as s3.
