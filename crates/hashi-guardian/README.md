# hashi-guardian

Guardian enclave service that emits immutable S3 logs for audit/state-restart workflows.

The S3 bucket operator is untrusted. Log signatures bind the intent, schema
version, session ID, timestamp, intended object key, and event. Readers compare
the signed key in JSON with the actual S3 key and reject relocated or
non-canonical records. All object keys are deterministic.
Every record is signed, including the OI attestation record, which is signed by
the session key it attests. Readers verify the attestation before trusting that
key to verify log signatures.

Guardians emit and read a single log schema, with `schema_version: 1` reset
for the testnet wipe. Pre-wipe records are no longer supported. KP-share records
carry one recipient fingerprint and one ciphertext per share. The
`VersionedLogMessage` wrapper retains explicit version dispatch for future
schema changes.

## Initialization and build identity

One EIF serves both ceremony and withdraw sessions. `OperatorInit` selects the
mode and supplies deployment configuration and S3 credentials; bucket, region,
mode, and the reported Git revision are not embedded in the image.

Tooling verifies an independently approved PCR before initialization and the
signed deployment summary afterward. The revision is a label, not proof of the
source. The host's S3 forwarders must match the configured bucket and region.

## Heartbeat write fencing

Every Guardian S3 log write is serialized. After the first successful
withdraw-mode heartbeat, the writer allows another attempt only when its full
timeout fits before the latest successful heartbeat plus the reader's quiet
period minus the clock-skew budget. Successful non-heartbeat writes do not
extend that deadline.

The writer captures a monotonic timestamp immediately before constructing the
signed heartbeat record and renews its local deadline only after S3 confirms
the write. Readers independently apply the same quiet period to the heartbeat's
signed wall-clock timestamp. The fencing argument makes these assumptions:

- **Assumption 1: clock skew does not make the activating reader's quiet-period
  boundary occur before the writer's fence.**
  - **What it is:** The clocks need not be identical. The safety requirement is
    that the reader must not declare the prior session quiet while the writer is
    still allowed to make a write. The writer places its fence
    `ACTIVATING_READER_CLOCK_SKEW_BUDGET` before the reader's quiet-period
    boundary. Reader-ahead skew and any post-deadline S3 durability delay share
    that margin; their combined duration must not exhaust it.
  - **Where we make it:** `LogWriter::write` captures the monotonic renewal time
    immediately before `SignedLogEntry::new` captures the signed wall-clock time, and
    `LatestHeartbeatTime` subtracts the skew budget from the writer's fence.
    Heartbeat readers derive inactivity from the signed timestamp and the full
    quiet period.
- **Assumption 2: monotonic time advances across platform suspension.**
  - **What it is:** A paused enclave cannot resume with its local write deadline
    still artificially in the future.
  - **Where we make it:** `LatestHeartbeatTime` and all writer deadlines use
    `tokio::time::Instant`; the fencing proof requires this clock to advance
    while the platform is suspended.
- **Assumption 3: suspension does not resume execution within one future poll.**
  - **What it is:** Execution does not pause between a deadline check and
    network transmission, or between the final time check and result
    propagation.
  - **Where we make it:** `complete_before_attempt_deadline` checks the timer
    before polling the S3 future and checks time again after that future
    completes, but cannot inspect execution inside one poll.
- **Assumption 4: S3 does not make a timed-out request durable arbitrarily
  later.**
  - **What it is:** Cancelling a request future cannot retract a PUT already
    accepted by S3. If that PUT becomes durable after its local deadline, the
    delay plus any reader-ahead clock skew remains within
    `ACTIVATING_READER_CLOCK_SKEW_BUDGET`.
  - **Where we make it:** `complete_before_attempt_deadline` drops the S3 future
    when its timer wins.

## S3 log key format

These keys assume one Hashi deployment and BTC-key lineage per bucket. Epochs
and sequence numbers are scoped to that bucket, as is the singleton genesis record.

Canonical key layout:

- `init/{session_id}/01-oi-attestation.json`
- `init/{session_id}/02-oi-guardian-info.json`
- `init/{session_id}/03-pi-enclave-fully-initialized.json`
- `init/{session_id}/04-oa-activated.json`
- `heartbeat/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}/{session_id}-{counter:020}.json`
- `withdraw/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{hh}/{seq:020}-wid{wid}.json`
- `kp-shares/proposed/{session_id}.json`
- `ceremony/{sharing_seq:020}.json`
- `kp-shares/{sharing_seq:020}/{cert_seq:020}.json`
- `genesis/record.json`
- `committee-update/{new_epoch:020}.json`

Where:

- `session_id` is the first 16 hex chars of the enclave ephemeral signing pubkey (lowercase). Acts as a short per-session tag in keys; full pubkey verification still happens via the signed log payload (`SessionID::HEX_LEN` in `hashi-types`).
- `counter` is a zero-padded decimal sequence number (used in heartbeats only).
- `seq` (in `withdraw/`) is the zero-padded limiter sequence number consumed by the withdrawal.
- `sharing_seq` (in `ceremony/`) is a zero-padded sharing-instance sequence. The enclave chooses one above every completed ceremony and occupied finalized-share directory; an empty deployment starts at `0`. Interrupted attempts can leave gaps.
- `cert_seq` (in `kp-shares/`) is a zero-padded recipient-cert state counter within one `sharing_seq`. Setup/rotation write `0`; future individual KP cert rotations append higher values.
- `new_epoch` (in `committee-update/`) is the zero-padded just-applied committee epoch. Hashi reconfig is sparse, so it is not guaranteed to be `from_epoch + 1`.

## Stream semantics

- `init` logs are grouped per session and numerically ordered by lifecycle step.
- `heartbeat` logs are hour-partitioned and strictly ordered per session.
- `withdraw` logs contain only successful withdrawals and are hour-partitioned. Recovery walks date/hour directories in descending numeric order, rejects a selected directory whose spelling is noncanonical, and takes the highest-sequence limiter state from verified logs in the latest non-empty hour and the preceding hour.
- `kp-shares/proposed` contains one session-addressed ceremony proposal with the ceremony metadata and initial encrypted KP shares. Ceremony participants read this record before confirmation. Proposals use the short object-lock policy and are not authoritative serving state.
- `ceremony` logs are flat (not date-partitioned) and contain only completed ceremonies. After every KP confirms a proposal, the guardian writes its initial finalized `kp-shares` state and then its `CeremonyLogMessage`; the ceremony write is the commit record. `NewKey { instance }` represents initial key setup and `Rotate { old_instance, new_instance }` advances to a greater `sharing_seq`. Both skip sequences occupied by interrupted attempts. A rotation records the `old_instance` it consumed so the chain is auditable from the log alone. Readers select the lexicographically last ceremony as the current authoritative instance.
- Finalized `kp-shares` logs carry the current encrypted KP share state for a completed `sharing_seq`. Setup and KP-set rotation publish `cert_seq=0` during ceremony completion; individual KP cert rotations append higher `cert_seq` entries. Each share id has one recipient fingerprint and one PGP-encrypted ciphertext. Readers take the lexicographically last entry under `kp-shares/{sharing_seq:020}/`. Integrity is the enclave signature, not S3 immutability, so these get only a short object lock (a fetch-window guarantee) and stay readable until purged.
- `genesis` is a fixed singleton record carrying the first-deploy committee, Hashi object id, and MPC master `G` after KP-authorized PI reaches threshold, before any `committee-update/` success exists.
- `committee-update` logs contain only applied transitions and are flat (not date-partitioned). They are epoch-sorted, so the lexicographically last key is the latest applied epoch.

## Why this layout

- `init/{session_id}/...` keeps init logs session-addressable.
- `heartbeat/...` and `withdraw/...` date partitions support efficient hour-based polling.
- `ceremony/` and `committee-update/` are flat because the consumer always wants "latest"; a lex sort over the whole prefix is cheap and gives that directly. `kp-shares/proposed/` is session-addressed because a live ceremony has exactly one proposal. Finalized `kp-shares/` is nested by `sharing_seq` because readers want the latest cert state within one current sharing instance. `genesis/record.json` is fixed because there is at most one bootstrap record.
- Zero-padding (`{seq:020}` in `withdraw/`, `{sharing_seq:020}` in `ceremony/`, `{cert_seq:020}` in `kp-shares/`, `{new_epoch:020}` in `committee-update/`) makes lexicographic order over the keys equal seq/epoch order. The signed log payload embeds the same value, so a fetched object's filename and content can be cross-checked.
- Prefixes (`init`, `heartbeat`, `withdraw`, `ceremony`, `kp-shares`, `genesis`, `committee-update`) allow independent S3 deletion policies.

Completed ceremony, finalized share, withdrawal, and committee-update keys omit
the session ID; the signed record still authenticates its writing session.
Conditional writes reject different records at an occupied key. Ceremony sequence
selection assumes one ceremony writer and occurs before the proposal is signed
and confirmed by KPs. Initial setup rejects any existing completed ceremony;
subsequent ceremonies must rotate the existing key. If an enclave dies after publishing initial shares but
before the ceremony commit, its replacement chooses a higher sharing sequence.
Recovery follows the latest completed ceremony and only reads shares under that
sequence, leaving abandoned attempts unused.
An abandoned sequence remains occupied while its directory appears in S3 version
history, including delete markers. Permanently purging all of that history can
make an uncommitted sequence reusable; completed ceremony records retain the
committed sequence history.
