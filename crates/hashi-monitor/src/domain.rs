//! Domain model for the monitor.
//!
//! We model the cross-system withdrawal flow as a sequence of events:
//! - E1 or E_hashi: Hashi approval event on sui (corresponds to WithdrawalPickedForProcessingEvent)
//! - E2 or E_guardian: Guardian approval event on S3 (corresponds to NormalWithdrawalSuccess)
//! - E3 or E_btc: BTC tx broadcast
//!
//! Predecessor checks: for every E_{i+1}, there exists a corresponding E_i within a small clock skew.
//! Successor checks: for every E_i, there exists a corresponding E_{i+1} within time `t`.
//!
//! TODO: Track IOP-203 which plans to add a check in Sui: match the withdrawal destination & amount that a user inputs with that in E_hashi.
//! The monitor is insecure without this check as a malicious hashi committee can include an arbitrary destination address.
