//! Structural apply of one transaction's changed objects into the
//! mirror.
//!
//! The unit of work is a [`TxView`]: the full post-state of every
//! object a Hashi-touching transaction wrote, plus the ids it deleted.
//! [`apply_transaction`] routes each object by ownership (see
//! [`super::route`]) and updates the matching `types::Hashi` map, so
//! the mirror no longer depends on events — a Move mutation with no
//! `event::emit` still arrives here as an object write.
//!
//! Side effects that used to ride the event path (limiter advance,
//! notifications) are returned as [`Effect`]s derived from state
//! transitions; the caller owns acting on them.
