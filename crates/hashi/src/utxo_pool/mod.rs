//! UTXO pool management and coin selection for Bitcoin withdrawal transactions.
//!
//! This module provides a coin selection algorithm that simultaneously:
//! - Selects UTXOs to fund one or more withdrawal requests in a single transaction.
//! - Amortises UTXO pool maintenance by aggressively consolidating inputs back
//!   into a small target number of UTXOs via a change output.
//!
//! The miner fee is split equally among the selected withdrawal requests and
//! deducted from each request's output amount. The fee must not exceed a
//! configurable per-request cap (`CoinSelectionParams::max_fee_per_request`),
//! and is sourced entirely from the request amounts. When spending
//! unconfirmed change (CPFP), the per-request deduction also includes any
//! deficit needed to bring the ancestor package fee rate up to the target.
//! The fund balance decreases by `sum(request.amounts)` for confirmed inputs
//! and by `sum(request.amounts) + cpfp_deficit` when ancestor boosting is
//! needed.

/// 2. **Input selection** — UTXOs are sorted largest-first and selected
///    greedily until `input_total >= total_requested`. Both confirmed
///    and pending UTXOs are eligible, subject to the
///    `max_mempool_chain_depth` filter.
///
/// 3. **Consolidation** — if there is change (excess input value) and
///    the fee rate is favourable, extra *confirmed* UTXOs are pulled in
///    smallest-first to reduce the UTXO set. Aggressiveness depends on
///    the fee environment:
///    - Below `long_term_fee_rate`: up to `input_budget × N` extras.
///    - Between long-term and `high_fee_rate_threshold`: up to
///      `input_budget × N / 2` extras.
///    - At or above high threshold: no consolidation.
///
/// 4. **Fee allocation** — `finalize_fees` computes the total deduction
///    (own fee + CPFP deficit + dust padding), checks it against the
///    per-request cap, verifies each output stays above dust, assigns
///    net amounts, and derives the actual miner fee from conservation.
///
/// # Preconditions
///
/// The caller must provide a **consistent, non-overlapping UTXO set**.
