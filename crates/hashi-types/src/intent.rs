//! Domain-separation intents for everything a Hashi member signs, under its
//! BLS key or its TLS key.
//!
//! The signing preimage is `intent (u16 LE) || bcs(hashi object id) ||
//! bcs(epoch) || bcs(message)`, except where a message is not epoch-scoped and
//! omits the epoch. Every message type signed under a member's keys
//! carries a unique intent value, so a certificate produced
//! for one message type can never verify as another, regardless of whether
//! two types happen to share a BCS layout, and the Hashi object id binds
//! every signature to one deployment, so a certificate minted for another
//! Hashi instance can never verify here.
//!
//! [`Intent`] is a `#[repr(u16)]` enum with explicit discriminants: the
//! compiler rejects two variants sharing a value, and each message type names
//! a variant (not a raw number), so a typo'd or reused intent fails to compile.
//! The wire value is the discriminant, taken via `as u16` — never serde's enum
//! encoding (which is the variant index, not the discriminant).
//!
//! This registry mirrors `packages/hashi/sources/core/intent.move`; the two
//! MUST stay in sync — `intent_values_are_stable` below pins the on-wire
//! values so the Rust side cannot drift silently, and the e2e suite is the
//! true cross-language check. Allocation blocks, one per domain, with room to
//! grow within each:
//! - `0x0000..=0x00FF`: core protocol (committee lifecycle, MPC ceremonies)
//! - `0x0100..=0x01FF`: Bitcoin
//! - `0x0200..`: reserved for future chains, one block each

/// Signing-domain registry. Each variant's discriminant is the on-wire intent
/// value; explicit values let the compiler catch collisions.
