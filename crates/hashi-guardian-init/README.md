# hashi-guardian-init

Off-enclave tooling that initializes a guardian. It reads the guardian's S3 logs
via `hashi_guardian::s3_reader`, verifies the attested enclave, and drives the
initialization flows. It also houses guardian helper tooling and dev-only
shortcuts.

## production flow

The production guardian initialization flow is split by actor:

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator ceremony --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner ceremony --config guardian-init.sample.yaml --encrypted-shares-path /secure/path/kp-shares.json
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator provision --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner provision --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator activate --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner rotate-cert --config guardian-init.sample.yaml --new-kp-pgp-cert-path /path/to/kp3-new.asc
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator rotate-kp-set init --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner rotate-kp-set --config guardian-init.sample.yaml --submission-path /path/to/kp3.rotation
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator rotate-kp-set submit --config guardian-init.sample.yaml --submission /path/to/kp1.rotation --submission /path/to/kp3.rotation
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator rotate-kp-set wait --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
```

On first deploy, add `--do-genesis` to the `operator provision` command and
every `key-provisioner provision` command. Omit it for replacement deployments.

Provision each KP's YubiKey and collect its public certificate, fingerprint text
file, and three PEM sidecars using the
[provisioning and artifact handoff guide](../../key-provisioner/provision.md).

Config fields contain only `.asc` paths. Keep matching sidecars beside each
certificate on every certificate-loading host, including for signers and
replacements. The CLI verifies and sends bundles; the guardian independently
rejects missing or invalid proofs. These YubiKey provenance checks are separate
from the guardian Nitro attestation checks below.

The key ceremony and provisioning flow is then driven through these commands.
All production commands read the same unified config file; see
[`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml).
Every S3 writing session must match its configured bucket, region, retention
environment, and Bitcoin network. Historical builds are accepted through the
configured PCR allowlist.

For a fully-local end-to-end run of this flow (local sui node + a dockerized
guardian, no devnet), see [`docker/hashi-guardian-local`](../../docker/hashi-guardian-local).

The required `deployment` block contains the bucket/region, retention environment,
Bitcoin network, and PCR allowlist. The optional `s3_credentials` block supplies
`access_key`, `secret_key`, and an optional `session_token`; omit the entire block
to use the AWS SDK default credential chain.

## operator ceremony

The production guardian key ceremony — genesis setup, run once by the operator.

One S3 bucket is involved: the guardian's **log bucket** (object-lock enabled).
The guardian writes its `init/` attestation and a session-addressed
`kp-shares/proposed/` record here. The operator and key provisioner ceremony
commands both verify that proposal. Once every KP confirms, the guardian
publishes the finalized `kp-shares/` recovery state and `ceremony/` audit log.

Drives a fresh **ceremony-mode** guardian through the one-time genesis BTC key
setup (`sharing_seq = 0` in an empty deployment; interrupted attempts are skipped).
Setup rejects an existing completed ceremony; use KP-set rotation for an established key. It connects over gRPC and: `operator_init` (ceremony mode, shared deployment configuration) →
`setup_new_key` → verifies the response signature and shape → confirms each
share's recipient matches its expected KP cert and its PGP-encrypted ciphertext
targets that cert (parsed without decrypting) →
cross-checks the guardian's `kp-shares/proposed/` record. It then waits for every
KP to confirm successful share recovery and for the finalized `kp-shares/` and
`ceremony/` records to be published.

Operator initialization installs the configured S3 destination, retention policy,
Bitcoin network, and PCR allowlist. The enclave checks its own attestation against
`current_build` before committing initialization.

`kp_roster.kp_pgp_cert_paths` lists one certificate per KP, in any order.
New ceremonies assign share IDs by fingerprint order; existing assignments
come from signed `kp-shares/` state. Each ciphertext must contain exactly one
OpenPGP recipient matching its KP's attested DEC key. The primary key must be
the attested SIG key, so its fingerprint identifies both the KP and its signing key.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator ceremony --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
```

Config: see [`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml). This
command uses `guardian_endpoint`, `hashi`, and `kp_roster`.

## key-provisioner ceremony

Confirms a KP can fetch and decrypt their share from the live setup or rotation
ceremony. Trust is anchored to the guardian's S3 attestation log: it verifies
the live guardian, reads that session's exact `kp-shares/proposed/` record, and
checks the proposal against the live secret-sharing instance and expected
`n`/`t`. It then confirms each share's recipient and PGP-encrypted ciphertext
match the expected KP cert, uses `kp_pgp_cert_path` to identify and decrypt this
KP's share, and verifies its commitment. After verification it saves the full
proposed ceremony state, including every KP's encrypted share and the public
ceremony data, then signs and submits `ceremony_artifacts_digest` and the session
to the live guardian. `CeremonyArtifacts` binds that state to the KP's independently
configured deployment policy. The guardian completes
the ceremony and publishes the finalized `kp-shares/` and `ceremony/` records
only after all KP/share entries have confirmed. For rotations,
the ceremony guardian must keep running after `RotateKpSet` returns until
every new KP has confirmed; `operator rotate-kp-set submit` (or `wait`) waits
for that.

Both ceremony commands verify live guardian info and Nitro attestation against
the configured current build. The KP additionally anchors the proposal to its
writing session's S3 `init/` attestation. Through the
proxy, the KP's `guardian_endpoint` answers with the guardian KPs are
provisioning (`GetProvisioningTargetInfo`): the standby during a KP-set
rotation, else the active guardian. A bare guardian endpoint answers for
itself.

The selected ciphertext is piped from memory to `gpg` over stdin. No temporary
ciphertext or plaintext file is written locally; only the verified ceremony
state containing the encrypted shares is persisted.

`kp_pgp_cert_path` must name a certificate in `kp_roster`.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner ceremony --config guardian-init.sample.yaml --encrypted-shares-path /secure/path/kp-shares.json
```

Config: see [`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml). This
command uses `kp_pgp_cert_path`, `hashi`, and `kp_roster`.

## operator provision

Initializes a fresh **withdraw-mode** guardian with operator-supplied stable
config — the production `OperatorInit` half of provisioning.

It:

1. Fetches and verifies the fresh withdraw-mode guardian's live `GuardianInfo`
   against the configured current build, and confirms it is not already
   operator-initialized.
2. Reads the latest attested ceremony from S3 and verifies its encrypted-share
   recipients against the expected KP roster and its Bitcoin network against
   the configured network.
3. Reads the latest `committee-update/` or `genesis/` record if one already exists.
4. Builds the withdraw-mode `InitConfig` from limiter config and the shared
   deployment policy.
5. Requires the observed serving-committee state to agree with the
   `--do-genesis` intent marker. On first deploy, the flag causes it to build an
   optional `GenesisState` from the current on-chain committee, configured Hashi
   object id, and MPC master `G`; otherwise a serving committee must already
   exist.
6. Calls withdraw-mode `OperatorInit` with guardian S3 config, `InitConfig`, and
   the optional genesis state; the enclave pins all three inputs plus the latest
   complete ceremony and KP-share state. The enclave obtains the immutable Hashi
   object id and MPC master `G` from verified genesis, or from the supplied genesis
   state on first deploy. Only `--do-genesis` consults on-chain state.
7. Verifies the live and S3-logged `GuardianInfo` match the installed ceremony
   instance and stable config.
8. Prints the config and optional genesis hashes that key provisioners must
   verify before submitting shares.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator provision --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
```

On first deploy, add `--do-genesis`. The flag is purely an explicit intent
marker; the committee and MPC master `G` still come from on-chain state, while
the Hashi object id comes from config. All three require threshold KP
authorization during PI.

Config: see [`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml). This
command uses `guardian_endpoint`, `deployment`, `hashi`,
`kp_roster`, and `limiter_config`.

Lowering `max_bucket_capacity` can strand a committed batch and stop all
withdrawals. Pause the bridge first, then keep the new cap at or above the
outflow of every batch `hashi withdraw list` shows as Committed. Unpause once
every node's `hashi_guardian_limiter_max_capacity` shows the new cap.

## key-provisioner provision

A one-shot flow run by a key provisioner for a new guardian instance, either on
first deploy or when replacing a guardian that went down. Each KP decrypts
through their yubikey-backed gpg setup; plaintext never touches disk, but the
raw share scalar is held in this process' memory long enough to verify and
re-encrypt it. It:

1. Fetches and verifies the relay/standby endpoint's signed `GuardianInfo`
   (attestation-anchored), pinning the standby session.
2. Fetches the same session's signed `GuardianInfo` from S3 and requires it to
   match the endpoint response, then checks the enclave's config against expected
   values — deployment policy, limiter config, and that the guardian is
   not already provisioner-initialized or activated.
3. Scrapes the authoritative `ceremony/` log for the secret-sharing instance
   (commitments + N + T + sharing_seq) the new guardian was booted with, and
   confirms it matches.
4. Recomputes the stable `InitConfig` from limiter config and deployment policy,
   then confirms
   its `config_hash` matches the enclave.
5. Requires the observed serving-committee state to agree with the
   `--do-genesis` intent marker. With the flag, independently derives the
   current on-chain committee, configured Hashi object id, and MPC master `G`
   into `genesis_state_hash`; confirms the optional hash matches the enclave.
6. Reads this KP's PGP-encrypted share from the latest `kp-shares/{seq}/`
   state, verifies every share's recipient against the roster, then decrypts
   the share selected by `kp_pgp_cert_path` and verifies its commitment
   (`gpg --decrypt` over a pipe; the plaintext stays in memory and never
   touches disk).
7. HPKE-encrypts the decrypted share to the new guardian's `encryption_pubkey`
   from its `GuardianInfo`.
8. Signs the exact `(session, config_hash, optional genesis_state_hash,
   encrypted share)` submission and sends it to the configured relay endpoint.
   The relay pre-verifies and collects T-of-N distinct submissions; the enclave
   then authoritatively re-verifies every signature and request binding before
   completing `ProvisionerInit`. On first deploy, that same threshold authorizes
   writing the committee to `genesis/record.json`.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner provision --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
```

On first deploy, each KP adds `--do-genesis`. The flag is purely an intent
marker; the signed optional genesis hash remains the authorization.

See [`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml) for the unified
config. This command uses `kp_pgp_cert_path`, `relay_endpoint`, `hashi`,
`kp_roster`, and `limiter_config`. The MPC committee verifying key `G` is fetched
from on-chain Hashi state only with `--do-genesis`.

## key-provisioner rotate-cert

Replaces this KP's sole OpenPGP cert for the active guardian without changing
the BTC key, sharing instance, threshold, or share id. Individual rotation
requires possession of the old private key because its certificate signs the
request and decrypts the current share. If that sole key is lost, it cannot be
recovered through `rotate-cert`; the KPs must authorize a quorum-based
`RotateKpSet` ceremony instead.

Obtain the replacement certificate's matching three PEM sidecars and
primary-key fingerprint text file using the
[provisioning guide](../../key-provisioner/provision.md#provide-the-public-artifacts-to-the-operator),
just as for initial setup. `--new-kp-pgp-cert-path` takes only the new `.asc`
path, with matching sidecars beside it. Keep the old signer's bundle available
too. The command verifies both bundles and signs the replacement bundle into
the rotation request; the guardian rechecks both.

It:

1. Loads the old signing cert from `kp_pgp_cert_path`, requires it to be present
   in `kp_roster`, and loads a replacement cert whose fingerprint does not
   collide with the roster.
2. Fetches and verifies the active guardian's `GuardianInfo` through
   `relay_endpoint`, then requires its BTC public key to match the latest
   attested `ceremony/` log and uses that log's sharing instance.
3. Verifies the latest `kp-shares/{sharing_seq}/` state against the configured
   certificate set, decrypts this KP's share, and checks its commitment.
4. HPKE-encrypts the same share to the guardian, signs the request with the old
   cert, binds the observed `cert_seq` to reject stale updates, and calls
   `ProvisionerRotateCert` through the relay.
5. Verifies the signed response and next `kp-shares/` snapshot: only this share's
   recipient and ciphertext change, targeting the new cert and retaining its ID.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner rotate-cert \
  --config guardian-init.sample.yaml \
  --new-kp-pgp-cert-path /path/to/kp3-new.asc
```

After success, replace this KP's certificate path in `kp_roster` with the new
path and update `kp_pgp_cert_path` to match.

## operator rotate-kp-set

Re-deals the ceremony key to a new KP set (`new_kp_roster`: new certs, `n`
and `t`) on a fresh **ceremony-mode** guardian, without changing the key. The
guardian that serves withdrawals keeps signing throughout; a replacement
guardian is then provisioned by the new set (`operator provision` without
`--do-genesis`, `key-provisioner provision` by the new KPs) and, once the old
guardian is stopped, activated.
Rotating the set changes who can provision future guardians. It also changes
who the serving guardian and the proxy accept KP-signed calls from: both
resolve the roster from the latest committed `kp-shares/`, so once every new
KP confirms and the rotation commits, the old certs can no longer `rotate-cert`. The old set's encrypted
shares remain in earlier `kp-shares/` entries.

Like a new ceremony, the rotation deals share ids in fingerprint order, so
`new_kp_roster.kp_pgp_cert_paths` may be listed in any order; every KP and the
operator still need the same set, `n` and `t`.

`init` calls ceremony-mode `OperatorInit`, pins the session against its S3
attestation, verifies the latest `ceremony/` + `kp-shares/` logs against the
dealt `kp_roster`, and prints the session and the proposal for the current KPs
to compare against their own. Each current KP then runs
`key-provisioner rotate-kp-set` and sends the operator its submission file.

`submit` decodes the files, checks what the enclave will check (signature,
pinned session, each signer's share assignment, one submission per share,
agreement with this config's `new_kp_roster` and complete deployment configuration, the dealt
set's threshold), calls `RotateKpSet` in one batch, verifies the guardian-
signed response (a greater enclave-selected `sharing_seq`, every share encrypted to the new certs)
and its session-scoped `kp-shares/proposed/` record, then waits for every new
KP's `key-provisioner ceremony` confirmation. The enclave publishes finalized
`kp-shares/{new_sharing_seq:020}/00000000000000000000.json` and
`ceremony/{new_sharing_seq:020}.json` records and completes only once
all `n` new KPs have confirmed, and the wait has no timeout. Interrupting it
is safe once the batch was accepted: `wait` reads the pinned guardian's own
proposal, verifies it against `new_kp_roster` and resumes the wait, while
`submit` refuses a guardian that already dealt. The ceremony guardian must
keep running until confirmation and publication complete; until then, the
previous finalized KP set remains authoritative.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator rotate-kp-set init --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator rotate-kp-set submit --config guardian-init.sample.yaml --submission /path/to/kp1.rotation --submission /path/to/kp3.rotation
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator rotate-kp-set wait --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
```

Config: see [`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml). These
commands use `guardian_endpoint`, `deployment`, `kp_roster` (the dealt set)
and `new_kp_roster`.

## key-provisioner rotate-kp-set

One current KP's contribution to a KP-set rotation. It:

1. Fetches and verifies the ceremony guardian's `GuardianInfo` through
   `guardian_endpoint` (attestation, `operator_initialized`, git revision,
   deployment summary), then requires the same session's S3 `init/` attestation.
2. Reads the latest attested `ceremony/` + `kp-shares/` state, verifies it
   against `kp_roster` and the configured Bitcoin network, and decrypts the share
   addressed to `kp_pgp_cert_path`
   (`gpg --decrypt` over a pipe; the plaintext stays in memory).
3. HPKE-encrypts the share to the guardian and signs a request binding it to
   the pinned session, `expected_deployment_config_hash`, and `new_kp_roster`'s
   certs and `n`/`t`. The hash comes from this KP's configured deployment policy;
   the enclave checks it against the policy installed during OI before using shares.
4. Writes the signed request to `--submission-path`: the wire message,
   prost-encoded. It holds nothing secret and can be sent to the operator
   over any channel.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner rotate-kp-set --config guardian-init.sample.yaml --submission-path /path/to/kp3.rotation
```

Config: see [`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml). This
command uses `kp_pgp_cert_path`, `guardian_endpoint`, `deployment`,
`kp_roster` and `new_kp_roster`. Every KP must sign the same proposal (the
new set, `n`, `t` and the deployment configuration): the enclave rejects a batch whose
submissions disagree.

## recovering a lost KP key

A KP whose sole YubiKey is lost or unusable cannot `rotate-cert` (that needs
the old key). Any `t` of the remaining KPs replace the whole set instead:

1. Leave the serving guardian alone: it holds the key in memory and keeps
   signing until step 7 stops it. Only its KP-signed surface changes: once
   step 5 commits, the old certs can no longer `rotate-cert`.
2. Agree on the new set: `n`, `t` and one cert per KP (a fresh YubiKey for the
   affected KP, or a different person). It goes in `new_kp_roster`;
   `kp_roster` stays the dealt set. Steps 3 to 6 verify against the ceremony
   session: `current_build` is the approved revision label/PCR pair, with
   older builds that dealt the current shares in `prev_builds`. Ceremony and
   withdraw sessions use the same EIF. The operator and every KP render from
   one config.
3. Operator: bring up a fresh ceremony-mode guardian on the standby slot,
   against the same bucket, then `operator rotate-kp-set init`.
4. Any `t` current KPs: `key-provisioner rotate-kp-set`, each sending the
   operator its submission file. The lost key takes no part.
5. Operator: `operator rotate-kp-set submit` with the files. It waits for the
   new KPs (`wait` resumes if interrupted).
6. Every new KP: `key-provisioner ceremony`, with `kp_roster` set to the new
   set.
7. Replace the standby slot with a fresh guardian using the same EIF and build
   mapping. `operator provision` selects withdraw mode (no `--do-genesis`), and
   `key-provisioner provision` by the new KPs run while the old guardian still
   serves. Switch traffic to the new guardian first, while that can still be
   undone: the proxy keeps serving already-signed withdrawals from its cache,
   and new ones get retriable errors until activation. Then stop the old
   guardian, which can't be undone (a restarted guardian is a new session
   that must be provisioned again), and run `operator activate`: it needs
   every other session in the bucket quiet for 10 minutes since its last
   heartbeat and retries until then.

The rotation does not revoke the old shares: `kp-shares/{old seq}/` stays
readable by the old certs, so `t` old keys could still reconstruct the key
offline. If that many old keys may be compromised, run a new key ceremony and
migrate on-chain instead.

[`docker/hashi-guardian-local`](../../docker/hashi-guardian-local)'s
`make rotate-kp-set` then `make reprovision` run this sequence with softkeys:
`t` of the dealt set sign, the new set is entirely new keys. The rig reaches
the ceremony guardian directly; the proxy's `ConfirmCeremony` route to the
provisioning target is covered by the proxy's own tests and by the rehearsal
on the `testing` stack.

## operator activate

Activates a provisioner-initialized **withdraw-mode** standby guardian.

It:

1. Fetches and verifies the live standby `GuardianInfo` against the configured
   current build, and confirms `provisioner_init` has completed but activation
   has not.
2. Verifies the standby's S3 `init/` identity/config still matches the live
   guardian.
3. Checks that all other guardian sessions in the configured S3 bucket have
   been quiet long enough (10 minutes since their last heartbeat), retrying
   for up to 15 minutes.
4. Reads the latest `committee-update/` or `genesis/` record, recovers the
   limiter state from successful withdrawal logs, computes the expected
   `ActivationState` hash, and calls `OperatorActivate`.
5. Verifies the guardian reports the expected active committee epoch and limiter
   state.

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- operator activate --config guardian-init.sample.yaml
```

Config: see [`guardian-init.sample.yaml`](guardian-init.sample.yaml). This
command uses `guardian_endpoint`, `deployment`,
`kp_roster`, and `limiter_config`. Activation does not query Sui.

## tools

Guardian helper tooling lives under `tools`:

```bash
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- tools fetch-info --endpoint <guardian-endpoint>
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init -- tools verify-kp-cert --kp-pgp-cert-path /path/to/kp1.asc
cargo run -p hashi-guardian-init --features non-enclave-dev -- tools dev-attest --kp-pgp-cert-path /path/to/kp1.asc
```

`fetch-info` prints a deployed guardian's public keys (signing key, or the
enclave BTC pubkey after provisioning), used by deploy to record them on-chain.
It verifies the GuardianInfo signature but does not verify Nitro attestation or
PCRs.

`verify-kp-cert` checks a KP certificate and its three PEM sidecars exactly as
certificate-loading commands do, then prints the primary-key fingerprint.

`dev-attest` exists only in `non-enclave-dev` builds. It writes a software KP
key's three PEM sidecars from a self-signed device that only `non-enclave-dev`
builds trust, so dev ceremonies (the devnet deploy, the local replica) run
without YubiKeys.
