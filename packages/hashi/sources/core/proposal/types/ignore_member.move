/// Governance proposal for ignoring (or re-admitting) a registered committee
/// member. An ignored member is treated as no longer part of the committee:
/// the next committee formation skips them, so their voting weight drops out
/// of total stake and every downstream threshold (certificates, proposal
/// quorums, MPC parameters) re-derives without them.
///
/// Semantics and limits:
/// - The flag takes effect at the next committee FORMATION (`start_reconfig`).
///   If a reconfiguration is already in flight when the proposal executes,
///   that is one epoch later — the pending committee is immutable once formed.
///   The current epoch's committee is never altered: bitmap indices, MPC
///   party ids, and leader rotation all stay intact until the boundary.
/// - The proposal targets the validator ADDRESS; it applies to whatever
///   registration holds that address at execute time, including a
///   re-registration after a deregistration cycle.
/// - Exclusion is only reachable while governance itself is live: this
///   proposal needs 6667 bps of the full current denominator, and the epoch
///   transition enacting it needs the outgoing committee's handoff
///   certificate at the same threshold (whose denominator still includes the
///   ignored member). Non-participating weight must therefore stay at or
///   below 3333 bps of the current committee — the standard BFT bound —
///   for the mechanism to help; beyond it the system is already stuck.
/// - Ignoring does not touch the registry: the member stays registered and
///   can be re-admitted by executing the same proposal type with
///   `ignored: false`. It can create and vote on proposals only while it is
///   still seated: both require a seat in the current committee, so once a
///   committee forms without it, it can do neither until it is re-admitted.
///   If every registered member were ignored, committee formation would
///   abort and the current committee would simply continue — recoverable by
///   un-ignoring.
