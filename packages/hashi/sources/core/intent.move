/// Domain-separation intents for everything a Hashi member signs, under its
/// BLS key or its TLS key.
///
/// The signing preimage is `intent (u16 LE) || bcs(hashi object id) ||
/// bcs(epoch) || bcs(message)`, except where a message is not epoch-scoped
/// and omits the epoch. Every message type signed under a member's keys
/// carries a unique intent value, so a certificate produced
/// for one message type can never verify as another, regardless of whether
/// two types happen to share a BCS layout, and the Hashi object id binds
/// every signature to one deployment, so a certificate minted for another
/// Hashi instance can never verify here.
///
/// This registry mirrors `crates/hashi-types/src/intent.rs`; the two MUST stay
/// in sync. Allocation blocks, one per domain, with room to grow within each:
/// - `0x0000..=0x00FF`: core protocol (committee lifecycle, MPC ceremonies)
/// - `0x0100..=0x01FF`: Bitcoin
/// - `0x0200..`: reserved for future chains, one block each
