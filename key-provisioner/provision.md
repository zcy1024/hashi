# Key Provisioner Setup

## Setting up 1Password

On your normal development MacBook, **not the MacBook Neo**, open 1Password
and select the **Personal vault in your business 1Password account**.

Use the 1Password password generator to create and save three separate random
passwords. Each must be **at least 12 characters long** and contain **letters,
numbers, and symbols**. Label each saved password clearly:

- **Hashi key provisioner - MacBook Neo login password** — for the local `kp` account.
- **Hashi key provisioner - YubiKey User PIN** — for signing and decryption.
- **Hashi key provisioner - YubiKey Admin PIN** — for administering the YubiKey's
  OpenPGP application.

Despite their names, the YubiKey OpenPGP PINs support letters, numbers, and
symbols; they are not limited to digits. Use a different generated password
for each of the three credentials. You will use these saved passwords during
the setup steps below.

Save the **serial number** printed on the back of the YubiKey you will set up
in the rest of these instructions in the same 1Password vault. Label it
**Hashi key provisioner - YubiKey serial number** so you can identify the
device associated with your saved PINs.

## Okta

On your **normal development MacBook, not the MacBook Neo**, register the same
YubiKey that you will provision in the later sections as an Okta passkey /
security key:

1. Sign in to [mystenlabs.okta.com](https://mystenlabs.okta.com) using your
   existing sign-in method.
2. Open your account menu and select **Settings**. Under **Security Methods**
   (sometimes labeled **Extra Verification**), find **Passkeys** or
   **Security Key or Biometric Authenticator** and select **Set up** or
   **Set up another**. Complete any reauthentication prompts.
3. Follow the browser prompts and choose **Security key**. If the browser
   initially offers another passkey provider, choose the option to use a
   different passkey or another device, then select **Security key**. Store
   the credential on the physical YubiKey, not in 1Password, iCloud Keychain,
   or the Mac's Touch ID.
4. Connect the YubiKey to your development MacBook. If prompted, allow Okta
   to see the key's make and model, and touch the YubiKey when requested.
5. Complete enrollment and confirm that the new key appears in your Okta
   security methods.
6. On the Okta security methods page, label the newly added YubiKey
   **Hashi key provisioner YubiKey**.

Exact labels depend on the browser and your organization's Okta settings.
If security-key enrollment is unavailable, contact your Okta administrator.
See [Okta's enrollment guidance](https://help.okta.com/OIE/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/authenticators/passkeys-end-user-experience.htm).

### Provision the MacBook Neo

This procedure prepares the MacBook Neo to run Hashi key provisioner operations.
It updates macOS, clones the Hashi repository, installs Determinate Nix, and
applies the nix-darwin configuration that installs the required tooling.

1. Open Terminal and install macOS updates:

   ```sh
   sudo softwareupdate --install --all --restart
   ```

   Enter the `kp` account password when prompted. Updates may take some time.
   Wait for them to finish, including any required restarts, before continuing.
   If the Mac restarts, sign back in and reopen Terminal for the next step.

2. Install the Xcode Command Line Tools:

   ```sh
   xcode-select --install
   ```

   Find the installation pop-up window, select **Install**, and wait for the
   installation to finish before continuing.

3. Clone the Hashi repository into `~/hashi`:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/hashi.git ~/hashi
   ```

4. Enter the repository directory and run the setup script to install
   Determinate Nix and apply the nix-darwin configuration:

   ```sh
   cd ~/hashi
   ./key-provisioner/scripts/setup-mac.sh
   ```

   Enter the `kp` account password each time `sudo` prompts for it. If macOS
   asks whether to allow Terminal to administer your computer, select **Allow**.
   Setup may take some time.

   When setup finishes, the script prints **Setup complete** and restarts the
   Mac to apply the macOS settings.

5. After the restart, sign back in. When prompted to unlock **Nix Store**, enter
   the `kp` account password and check **Remember this password in my keychain**
   before unlocking it.

   Open **Ghostty** from the Dock and use it instead of macOS Terminal for all
   remaining commands. Ghostty was installed by the nix-darwin configuration.
   If Terminal reopened after the restart, quit it with **Command-Q** rather
   than continuing in the restored session.

   If macOS asks whether to allow Ghostty to modify system settings, access
   files or folders, or grant other permissions needed for provisioning,
   select **Allow** or approve the request.

   In Ghostty, return to the repository directory:

   ```sh
   cd ~/hashi
   ```

Congratulations, your MacBook Neo setup is complete! Continue below to set up
your YubiKey.

## Setting up your YubiKey

Each guardian key provisioner (KP) needs one YubiKey-backed OpenPGP certificate
that can encrypt and sign. During the guardian ceremony, Hashi encrypts the KP's
guardian share to that certificate. Later, the KP touches the YubiKey to decrypt
the share and touches it again to sign provisioning requests.

Generate dedicated keys for guardian provisioning. Do not reuse a personal key
or a node-backup key. The private keys remain on the YubiKey.

### Provision the YubiKey

Disconnect every YubiKey except the device being provisioned.

From the repository root, run the interactive provisioning script:

```sh
./key-provisioner/scripts/provision-yubikey.sh
```

Follow its prompts. The script changes the factory PINs, checks the SIG/DEC
slots, generates those keys, enables touch, and tests signing and decryption.
The SIG key is the OpenPGP primary key, used for signing and certification; the
DEC key is its encryption subkey. Verification requires the primary key itself
to match the SIG attestation, so the KP identity fingerprint identifies the
attested signing key. A separate, unattested certification primary is rejected.

When prompted for the new User PIN and Admin PIN, use the
**Hashi key provisioner - YubiKey User PIN** and
**Hashi key provisioner - YubiKey Admin PIN**, respectively, that you generated
and saved in 1Password above.

Empty SIG/DEC slots need no confirmation; existing keys require `y` or `yes`
before irreversible replacement. The Authentication slot is left unchanged.

The user ID only names output files; keys are selected by fingerprint. Choose
an output directory (default `.`). For user ID `jdoe`, the script retains these
five public files in that directory and prints the primary-key fingerprint:

```text
jdoe-kp-pubkey.asc
jdoe-kp-fingerprint.txt
jdoe-kp-pubkey.attestation-device.pem
jdoe-kp-pubkey.attestation-sig.pem
jdoe-kp-pubkey.attestation-dec.pem
```

The text file contains only the fingerprint. The PEMs contain the factory device
signer certificate and the SIG/DEC attestation statements. The public certificate
remains imported in your normal GnuPG keyring (or the caller's `GNUPGHOME`, if set).

### Provide the public artifacts to the operator

The operator will share a bucket name, an access key ID, and a secret access key
over a private channel.

Keep the YubiKey connected and all five generated public files together. Run
the upload script with the path to your `.asc` file:

```sh
./key-provisioner/scripts/upload-pubkey.sh ./jdoe-kp-pubkey.asc
```

Follow the prompts to enter the bucket name, access key ID, and secret access
key provided by the operator.

### Verify the operator's roster

When the operator posts the roster, keep your YubiKey connected and run:

```sh
./key-provisioner/scripts/show-fingerprint.sh
```

Find the row with your user ID and compare every group of four characters in
its fingerprint with the printed fingerprint. Check that the roster has one
row per participating KP. Confirm your row with the operator, or tell him
immediately if anything differs.

## Taking part in guardian operations

Once every KP has confirmed the roster, the operator publishes the guardian
configuration to the same bucket. Every KP then takes part in two steps: the
key ceremony, which deals each KP an encrypted share of the guardian key, and
provisioning, which hands those shares to a guardian.

### Download the operator's configuration

The operator posts a guardian commit and a configuration digest. Keep your
YubiKey connected and run, from the repository root:

```sh
./key-provisioner/scripts/download-config.sh
```

Enter the bucket name, access key ID, and secret access key you used to upload
your public files. The script downloads the configuration and every KP's
public files, verifies them, selects your certificate from the connected
YubiKey, and prints the directory it wrote them to.

If the script reports that your checkout is at a different commit than the
guardian, run the two `git` commands it prints, then run it again. The first
run builds the guardian tools, which can take several minutes.

Compare the configuration digest the script prints with the one the operator
posted, and tell the operator that it matches. Stop if it differs.

### Run the key ceremony

When the operator asks for the key ceremony, run the `cd` command the script
printed, then:

```sh
cargo run --release --locked -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner ceremony \
  --config guardian-init.yaml --encrypted-shares-path kp-shares.json
```

Your YubiKey asks for its User PIN and a touch to decrypt your share, and again
to sign your confirmation. Keep `kp-shares.json`: it holds every KP's encrypted
share and is the recovery record for the guardian key.

### Provision the guardian

When the operator asks for provisioning, run from the same directory:

```sh
cargo run --release --locked -p hashi-guardian-init -- key-provisioner provision \
  --config guardian-init.yaml
```

Add `--do-genesis` when the operator says this is the guardian's first
deployment. If the command stops with `is not live in S3`, the guardian has not
started its session yet: wait a minute and run it again.

If a step fails with `Inappropriate ioctl for device`, GnuPG has no terminal to
ask for your PIN on. Run `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` in the same terminal, then run
the step again.

After each step, tell the operator that it finished and post the last line it
printed. If a step fails for any other reason, send the operator its last lines
instead of working around it.
